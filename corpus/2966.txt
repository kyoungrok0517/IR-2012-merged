Your completely right buddy.  Not only CNN, but pretty much every news source besides, of course, Fox.  I can not watch the news because I simply get disgusted.  I can only watch Fox. Yes, Fox is biased toward republicans, however, they are obvious and outward about how they feel.  CNN, on the other hand, does it secretly, so most of the naive viewers do not notice they are completely being fooled and brainwashed.  It's like subliminal messaging.  You are of the very few who notices.  One more thing... of course, no news source will say this, and you would never hear it otherwise, but did you know that before Israel bombs an area, they drop flyers, not bombs, flyers, from planes, that read "WE ARE GOING TO BOMB THIS AREA, PLEASE EVACUATE" so that civilians do not get hurt.  After they do this, they text message every resident with a phone warning them to leave because that area is a target.  

Oh, and did you ever hear on the news how they have been bombing us pretty much forever, and that we did nothing, and right before we defended ourselves they threw more bombs than ever.  There is a reason it is called the IDF (Israeli Defense Force).  Because not once in history has the IDF attacked somebody.  Israel has always strictly defended itself.
