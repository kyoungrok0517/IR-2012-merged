So, I have to do a project where we make a hybrid animal. I choose to mix a alligator and a beaver haha,,,
can anyone help me answer these?
what woudl they hunt?
what would hunt them?
where could they live?
would it be able to live in salt water?

i know nothing about either of these animals, so this is hard haha.
thanks!
