You should look into a 529 with someon like Vanguard or take the next couple of months and review the many college funds available. 

It's investing a small amount monthly that will go a long way, plus the tax savings should be noted. If you do not file your own taxes, make sure to consult your filer/accountant about the benefits. Savings bonds are nice/safe, but the yield is far below what you can gain using alternative programs.
