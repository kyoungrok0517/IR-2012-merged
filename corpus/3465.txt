a redeck is no fun whatsoever,ive done thousands.you dont need harnesses,you need toeboards and roof jacks.you might also wanna google cougarpaws roofing boots.i wear mine everywhere,have a few pairs.better also find some old couch cushions and remove the foam squares from them.sit on the foam and youll stick like spider man.ive walked 14/12 shake roofs with moss on em in my cougar paws,but i was scared lol.
