Ok i bought a green spotted puffer fish yesterday at walmart, he is currently in a 10 gallon tank but as he gets bigger i plan on putting him in a large 80 gallon tank (hard to carry upstairs) lol he has 2 tablespoons of aquarium salt in his tank. the water has been conditioned and i run a filter and air pump. he has gravel floor with 1 fake plant and 1/2 a cocunut shell with a door cut in it. He is under 2 regular aquarium lights and the water temp stays around 72 degrees.

My question is will regular tropical fish food flakes work for him? i fed him this morning and he ate them then spit it back out in 25 litttle peices (normal?) he may or may not have eaten the peices. im not sure.
ive heard their teeth can grow too long like a beaver and theyll starve so what do i need to feed him? rams horn snails? bloodworms? Brine shrimp? is there a place i can order these from?
will he be alright on fish flakes for now? hes only about 1.5 inches long and the thing said he'll get up to six and live up to 15 years. he is alone in his aquarium. 

Any and all suggestions are extremely appreciated
thanks

BTW his name is puff-daddy   =]
