It's best to create a place that frogs find welcoming.  You need moisture, either a pond or a cool, damp garden, as on the north or east side of your house.  Frogs will come by themselves, eventually, if the place is right.  They are very sensitive to insecticides and other chemicals, so you can't use weed-killers, ant killers, roach spray, or anything like that or the frogs that come will just die.  If you haven't used a bunch of chemicals in and around your house, you can probably speed up the frog re-population process by finding a stream or pool nearby and catching some pollywogs.  Put them in a deep platter in your shady moist area with some of the water from where you found them.  Refill with rain water as needed, and keep cats and other animals from drinking out of their platter until they grow their legs and can crawl out of the water.  Keep the area protected so the baby frogs can grow up and you should be able to have a self-sustaining colony.
