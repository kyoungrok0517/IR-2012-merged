I have a 2-1/2 year old Black lab/Border Collie mutt. Recently (within the last month or so) we noticed that on her sides, her hair is thinning. In some places, her hair is coming out in wandering lines; the lines look worm-like in shape, although there is no redness, its not ringworm, she doesn't seem to be itchy, and it is not puffy or anything like that. We feed her quality food, and our other dog (a Bassett Hound) is not experiencing any skin problems. The only info I have found online about hair loss doesn't seem to fit the bill. Any other ideas?
