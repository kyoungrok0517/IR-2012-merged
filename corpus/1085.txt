Whoever gets the ticket (citation) loses. If one was not issued why not?  Sometimes, one can be issued even after the fact.  If on private property - one may not issue.  I try to avoid turning anything into my insurance company if at all posssible - they will make you pay later regardless of fault. They also have access to any tickets issued in the last 7 years.
