I think I answered this a few weeks ago:

I think you will usually find players use an 18 or 19 ounce cue to play with but use a 20 to 21+ ounce cue to break with. I learned with (and am still using the same cue 23 years later) a 21.3 ounce Mali and found the weight very comfortable to me.

We're talking about using a tool that is as individual as the user. I don't believe there is a "correct" weight to use other than trying out what is comfortable to YOU.

Don't consider just the weight of the cue either. Consider the kind of tip you will have at the end of the shaft. A soft tip is usually good for a soft shooter (which I think we should ALL be) and a hard tip is suitable for a hard hitting shooter. Look for a comfortable diameter in the shaft. Mine is an 11 millimeter but some players prefer a 12 or 12.5 millimeter shaft, while other players prefer the feel of a snooker cue. That's sort of like using a number 2 pencil to me but that's where individual preferences come into play. You may also want to consider the length of the cue as well. Those are just some things to take into accout while you're looking for your cue.
