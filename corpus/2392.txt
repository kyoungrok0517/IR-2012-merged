I know earthquakes occur all the time but, does anybody have an idea why they occur more during morningtime?. Or, why do they also occur almost in the same time of the year?. For example: A mayor earthquake usually occurs around september and during the morning in the eastern pacific sea. I'm talking about the sismic zone that surrounds the Coccos tectonic plate next to southern Mexico. Could this be because of gravity or related?
