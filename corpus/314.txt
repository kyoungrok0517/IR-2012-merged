When you fast, your body becomes starved and wants to protect itself from major energy losses, so it holds in as much energy as it can, and you don't poop as much. The thing is, if your not pooping, then how are you getting rid of the toxins during the fast? Where do all the toxins going?

Why does skin improve after fasting for a while?
