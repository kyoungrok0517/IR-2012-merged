Once again, you're asking this question in a group made up of illiterate 14 year olds who GUESS at everything, who don't know baseball existed before 2002. Ask a professional. If you ask this question in here where clearly you will not get a legit answer, it appears you're simply making it up and I'm guessing this particular question is real. (like American Typo's poor guess there which isn't remotely correct - if the ball is real it's worth more)
