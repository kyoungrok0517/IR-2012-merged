In the near future, you will making big bucks.  Although the housing in Newport Beach, like in many other cities by the Pacific in Southern California, tend to be pricy, you should have no problem afford one with your salary.  

I personally like Newport Beach a lot.  It is one of my favorite fishing spots.
