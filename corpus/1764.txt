Well my dad got it done here in the US, and what they did was cut some of his hair from the bottom back and then one by one start putting each hair into your scalp, forming the hair line you want (This is going to sound groose, but it's how they really do it. They poke your scalp with all these little holes and put one by one). My dad just got it on the front sides. He said it was very painfull, and he has blonde hair so at the begining you cant really tell he got it done baecause the hairs are really short, but in a couple of weeks you will notice the diference, that hair will get longer and start taking form. It looks very good if you ask me lol you would never know he had that done. About the price I am not sure, but for sure it is not cheap!
