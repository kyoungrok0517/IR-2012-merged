You need to avoid, chewy foods as much as possible: bagels, gum, taffy. If you are going to eat an apple or something like that, make sure to cut it up, don't try to bite it. 

Sometimes I put a hot rag on my jaw joints and it helps, temporarily, but it helps, and ibuprofen helps as well. 

Definitely get you a bite guard to wear while you sleep, I have one and it does help.
