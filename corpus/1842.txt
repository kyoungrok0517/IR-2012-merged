I have a really good friend who thinks that the child his ex wife has may not be his.  How does he go about DNA testing through the court system?  They were living separately when she became pregnant and he has many reasons to believe that she may have become pregnant by another man while he was away serving his time in the Air Force.
Thank you but he isnt really iterested in the sensationalism.  He just wants to do what is right by the child ~ either way it turns out.
He's been paying but she refuses to let him see the child.  Its been several years and he is unable to pay for an attorney to get his visitation enforced.
