I'm doing a final project for college and it's focused on endangered animals... I need to find relevant information concerning population decrease throughout decades, historical geographic distribution and such.

I'm not asking you guys to find it for me, but hopefully to guide me or pinpoint me towards sources where I can research this data for myself. I have contacted the American Museum of Natural History and they were not very eager to release such data to a student (don't know why).

Thank you very much
I have also contacted the IUCN but they havent responded to me yet.
