After the Black Sox betting scandal in 1919 Babe Ruth drew many fans back to the game. With his amazing ability and power (he was baseball's first real power hitter who tried to hit a lot of home runs and succeeded). In the early 20s he single-handedly out-homered entire teams and literally changed the way baseball was played.  He also had a larger than life and fun loving personality and helped establish the Yankees as a dominant team in baseball.

I think many people saw him as a symnol of America's expanding power in the 1920s. America, in the 1920s,  was a comparatively young, dynamic and powerful nation but also wanted to be respected and loved the way Ruth was. Ruth's fun-loving persona captured something of the Roaring 20s era.
