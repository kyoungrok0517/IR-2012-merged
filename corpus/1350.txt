Hope this helps.

Edit:Supplements are just as healthy, some people just don't like putting chemicals into there bodies(Another reason to go vegan!:)) so they want to get it naturally. Thats pretty easy as I already showed you. I don't get why people jump to supplements when there are quite a few plants high in calcium. :)
