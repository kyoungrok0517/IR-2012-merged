I went to the woods and picked some mushrooms and made some mushroom salad with lettuce and tomatoes and ate it with some water. After about an hour something strange happened. I think I have reached nirvana. I have been reading about buddhism, and this must be it. I have totally lost my ego and my consciousness is of pure light. I have lost all my negative feelings. Should I start preaching now that I am a Buddha?
