No protein supplements are not steroids.  Protein supplements are where they gather protein from different sources of food and make it into a powder form.  So it's kind of like taking food and making it into a powder and eating it.  Steroids are hormones like testosterone and such, which your body naturally makes, taking it from an outside source eventually confuses your body and it stops making your own hormones leading to problems.  Protein supplements can made from different things, they have protein supplements where they take protein that is found in soy beans.  This will be perfect for you.  Also I don't know if you take milk, if you do then they make protein from milk this is called Whey protein.  Either soy bean protein or whey protein will be fine.
