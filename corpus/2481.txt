here is what i'm doing for my halloween party hope this helps

For a festive treat, serve slices of Absolutely Almond Pound Cake™ on orange or black plates. Dollop with peach preserves, whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.


Create an apparition appetizer! Shape our Sun-Dried Tomato & Feta Cheese Ball into a ghost and add two sliced black olives for the eyes.


Mold cream cheese into the shape of a hand on a small plate; press in whole almonds at the tips for fingernails. Spoon Mild Red Pepper Dip over the back of the hand as a ghoulish garnish.


Top Pumpkin Patch™ cupcakes with cream cheese frosting. To accent each one with a sweet spider, roll out a black gumdrop and cut out eight strips for legs. Stick another gumdrop on top, and place in the center of the cupcake.


Hollow out small pumpkins and fill with any of our dips, such as prepared Go! Go! Asiago Dip or Spinach & Herb Dip. Serve with Blue Aztec Chips for a festive touch. 


For a drop-dead centerpiece, top Truffle Fudge Brownies with chocolate frosting and stick tombstone-shaped cookies on top to resemble a graveyard.
