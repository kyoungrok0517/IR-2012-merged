Ruth did bat clean up his first 6 years as a Yankee. 1920 through 1925.
And he set several records while being the # 4 hitter.

Gehrig did not become a regular player with the Yankees until about 1/4 of the way through the 1925 season. He, Gehrig, did not become the # 4 hitter in the Yankee lineup until the start of the 1926 season.

Miller Huggins made the decision to bat Ruth third, mainly because of Ruth's phenomenal ability to get on base and also Gehrig had proved he could be an outstanding hitter too.

However, Ruth kept the # 3 uniform number. In fact, just about anything Ruth wanted while with the Yankees, he got.

You can look it up.
