Fortunately, it is a simple ration between the atomic weight of calcium and the molecular weight of calcium carbonate.

AW Ca = 40.08 g/mole
MW CaCO3 = 100.09 g/mol

114 mg Ca/L x (100.09 gm CaCO3)/(40.08 g Ca) = 285 mg CaCO3/L

So now you can go both ways, depending on what unit is given:

Hope that helped!
