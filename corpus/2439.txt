you need to work for nine quarters to qualify for social security.yes the money taken out of your paycheck is used to pay people who have retired.and yes the amount you pay is credited to your account for when you retire.most if not all the money you put in will be paid back to you in about three years.

unless we don't allow the dolts in congress to fix it.
