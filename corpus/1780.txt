A hair transplant is not the answer since they will only transplant hairs form other parts of your head, and like you stated your hair is fine. The hair grows from a tube like depression in the skin called a hair follicle. The diameter of the hair follicle is determined by heredity and cannot be changed at any point in your life. It is unfortunate that you have spent so much time trying to alter something that will never change. The only remedy would be to alter your thinking. Long tresses are not for fine hair, shorter choppier cuts will release the weight of your locks and therefore they will have more body. Try a cute bob like Cameron Diaz, experiment with body waves, score better professional  products specifically for fine hair. Do whatever you can, life is too short for this type of agony.
