Here is what Labor Unions have accomplished over the years. These are work rights that we take for granted everyday. Please don't hesitate to add to this list.

*They established a grievance process where workers go through steps of discipline rather than be instantly fired.
*They had an effect on non-unionized workplace to "keep it honest" and offer favorable wages and benefits.

All at the expense of the working man (who they callously laid off so that these greedy CEOs can fill their coffers.) They have to have their  bread buttered on both sides after all. 

No doubt the middle class under brutal attack. I blame this on greedy Multi-national cooperations (and the politicians they bought out) who ship jobs overseas in order to rake in huge profits. Also, they would bring in H1B visa holders (skilled immigrant workers) to take over jobs from qualified American workers--not because "they are more talented or sk
