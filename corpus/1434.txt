Nope, In your PA manual you got with your permit it states,WEAR THE RIGHT GEAR
When you ride, your gear is
“right” if it protects you. In any
crash, you have a far better chance of
avoiding serious injury if you wear:
• An approved helmet.
• Face or eye protection.
• Protective clothing.
clearly states these as 2 seperate items, The manual goes even further. PDF version is at http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/pdotforms/pa_forms_manuals/PUB147.pdf
