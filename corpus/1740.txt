Can't help you with Urdu name, but the common English name is "Butterfly Orchid." Perhaps if you took the Urdu words for Butterfly and orchid ???

On the other questions: Phalaenopsis and their relatives are amont the orchids which do NOT make pseudobulbs (like, say, Cymbidium orchids do), so obviously you can't propagate then this way. Instead the flowering stems will often make baby plants (like spider pants) and you can carefully pot up the babies when roots begin to emerge from the base.

Fragrance: The overwhelming majority of Phalaenopsis and their hybrids are not fragrant. In nature only a handful (2 or 3 or 4) species have any fragrance, most notably P. violacea, and hybrids made with this species often have some slight but pleasant fragrance. But if you are looking for fragrance, Phalaenopsis is definitely NOT the best group of ocrchids for you.
