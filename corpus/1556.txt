A consultant speaking on CNBC suggests that you have at least $200,000 for medical expenses alone ($400,000 per couple).

After that just consider your food, mortgage/rent, vacation, and other miscellaneous expenses.

Take inflation into account when you do your calculations.  Expect 3%-5% inflation per year.

My best advice is that if your employer matches your 401(k) contributions put in as much money as you can.  They are giving you free money after all.
