Generally speaking, the primary parts of the pool cue are as follows: Tip, ferrule, shaft, collar, joint, forearm, wrap and butt.  As to your question about the taper, there are two types of tapers:  a pro taper and a European or straight taper.  The pro taper is going to be the same diameter for the first 12-14" of the shaft, then gradually tapering down to the tip, while a European taper tapers down to the tip gradually from the end of the shaft rather than midway down.  There's a great diagram of this at the PoolDawg website:
