I would like to find out what the ideal conditions are for orchids to grow. This question comes in 4 parts:

1) What is the recommended pH for orchids to grow well?
2) Which temperature do orchids grow best at?
3) What is the recommended salinity of water for orchids to grow? (Unit: ppt)
4) What is the recommended amount of dissolved oxygen for orchids to grow? (Unit: mg/L)

If possible, please state the sources where you had your answers from.
