I heard that they usually use hair follicules from the back or the side of your head when they transplant them. I was just wondering if they could use hair from your chest or back? The only problem that I could see with doing this would be that the hair on your chest or back might be of a different grade or texture and might grow differently than the hair on your head if transplanted. But my question is, is it even possible to transplant hair follicules to your head from other places such as your chest or back?
