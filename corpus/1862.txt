I consider mtDNA and Y-chromosome testing as having more anthropological value than genealogical. The new autosomal "Family Finder" test at Family Tree DNA holds more potential value, as the database builds.

I have not checked into the autosomal tests offered at Sorensen yet. They will all depend on how large the existing databases with which to compare your results to, becomes. In the past Sorensen has not shared the databases they have. If they continue this the test will be of little value. GeneTree is selling Sorensens results in small pieces and with speculative results. GeneTree, rather than testing the haplogroup's defining markers, is 'predicting' them with dubious results.

None can yet give you the names of your kin. They will give you a bunch of numbers and letters and wish you luck.
