Good question Ashley. Lets see now, there is the thermometer, the barometer, the hygrometer, the psychrometer,  and the anemometer. We also include the aircraft as a flying instrument which collects observations of temperature, pressure, and wind; also there is the radar and satellite instruments such as passive radiometers  and active radars and space based as well as ground based lidars. Finally, the computer is used as an instrument which collects, analyzes, and then produces forecasts from observations from all the instruments listed above.
