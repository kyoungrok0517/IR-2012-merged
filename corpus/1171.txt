The babe Ruth auto is somewhat faded, maybe 4/10. The Ty Cobb auto is a little bit more faded, but still clearly visible, maybe 3/10. The Rogers Hornsby auto is in the worst condition, maybe 1.5/10. It is a Ban Johnson presidential ball, so its from 1901-1927, so all the players signed while playing. The ball is in pretty good condition. All autos are on side panels. It has a JSA and PSA letter of authentication.
