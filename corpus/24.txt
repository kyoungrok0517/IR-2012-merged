Yes....plain ol' garden-variety domestic shorthair cats can have that pattern.  It is officially known as the 'classic' tabby pattern....but 'marble tabby' is more descriptive.

I know this from years of studying cats and practicing as a DVM, but if I run across a link, I'll try to come back here and post it for you.
