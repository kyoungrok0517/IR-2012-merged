Katbat-Zinn - it hasn't helped much; and in the meditation CD, which  comes with the book,  Jon Kabat-Zinn is constantly talking throughout the meditation session and this causes a major distraction for me during my meditation sessions. *All of this is a bit long, so 'please' be patient and read all the information.  

I've called my doctor and asked him to raise the millgram strengh on the Symbyx - this may help some with the depression I daily experience. He said, yes, I can do this for you.  *In addition to taking my medicine 'I would like to learn the Buddhist view on depression and learn how to practice insight meditation to erradicate the depression or at least greatly lesson it'. I'd also like to help others I know, which suffer from depression - how they can effectively deal with depression through the practice of insight meditation'. 

*Some Important Questions I'd like to ask you:

Do you know of any good Buddhist books for me to read on the Buddhist view on Depression 'and' teaches how to erradicate depression or at least lesson depression (through the practice of insight meditation)?   *PLEASE list the books and the authors. Thank You.

*Do you know of any Buddhist Websites which teaches the Buddhist view on depression and teaches insight meditation to erradicate or at least lesson my suffering and the suffering of others?  PLEASE list those websites. Thank You.
