Donegal

gods own county, second biggest county in ireland and the furtest north. its windswept barren and can be cold but its beauty has to be seen to believed. priciple town is letterkenny. the shops and some of the accomadation is piss poor, but the bars the craic is 90 best guinness in the world and brilliant bar staff. the roads can be deadly though; from belfast you can be in donegal within an hour and a half just head up the M2 and your there. 

Where men are men, and sheep are slightly nervous...
