There is a difference, some helmets will have barely passed the approval process, others will have exceeded the requirements. So they have all passed a minimum, finding out which have exceeded that minimum and by how much is more difficult to discover.

The only system which grades helmets I can find is the UK SHARP rating, there may be others if you search hard enough.

Ultimately, if the best helmet in the world helmet does not fit properly it will not offer the best protection, so your priority should be fit.
