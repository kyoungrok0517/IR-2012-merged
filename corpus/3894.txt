I am a junior in high school, and by now, the teachers at my school expect you to know what you want to do when your older, and have your majors and colleges selected already. and I thought I did. I wanted to be a radiologic technologist, I was researching about it, the education behind it, the salary, everything. but then I looked at the risks behind radiology such as  Leukemia, skin cancer,  Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B, Herpes, asthma, ect.
and it's scary O.o
but it kinda was something i put my mind into.

I want a career in the Medical field, however, I do not want to be in the emergency room or any high pressure situation like that. and I love computers and technology, that's why I think radiography intrigued me.

should I stay with Radiologic technologist? or should i do something different?
if so what should I look into?
