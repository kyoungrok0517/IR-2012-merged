Alexander Graham Bell invented the Telephone in 1863 in Boston, Mass, USA.

Despite what the US Congress claims, the rest of the World knows that Bell was first.

Canada responded to the (silly) US motion by issuing its own Parliamentary Motion stating the Bell was the inventor of the telephone.

Ok so what, Bell invented it, despite what the US congress says.
Silly Americans re-writing history, not just Canadians - the rest of the World thinks that Bell invented the telephone.  And it is rewriting history.  You just don't like the fact that Bell was not an American.  And the US Congress is the arbiter of history now - what breathtaking arrogance!
See other inventions, television, lightbulb, radio to see how Americans lie about the past.  To help you out, Logie Baird, not Farnsworth, Swan, not Edison, Marconi, not Tesla.
