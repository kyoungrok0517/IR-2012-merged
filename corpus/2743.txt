Q: How do you find frogs and salamanders?
A: You can look for amphibians in a few ways. If you are looking for salamanders, then there are different ways to look for them depending on where they live. For salamander species that live on land, the easiest way to find them is by looking under or in logs or moss. For species that live in water, you often need to use a net to catch them, although if they live in small streams sometimes you can catch them by hand. The easiest way to catch frogs is to go out in the evening or at night and listen for their calls. The calls will lead you straight to the frog but it is still not always to see the calling frog. Sometimes it is necessary to search in trees, bushes, or grass before you catch the frog. Nets can be used to catch frogs that live in water. We also use nets to catch tadpoles and salamander larvae. or
