"When Linda Caine left Zimbabwe with her baby son in the 1970s she hoped she had left her past behind. However, twenty years on she begins to suffer from debilitating flashbacks to events that she had deeply repressed. Written with her therapist Robin Royston, this book describes their journey to unravel the shocking secrets from her childhood that lie at the heart of her depression."

"'How shall I die if that time comes? I need to know these things. They have to be planned.' It must look like an accident. She will deliberately drive off the road on her way home from her weekly shopping trip. After all, who commits suicide with a load of groceries in their car?"
