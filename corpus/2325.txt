Tornadoes and lightning are associated with the same phenomena - powerful updrafts in thunderstorms - but they are not otherwise connected.

Tornadoes form in the lower parts of thunderstorms when there is unstable air and a strong wind shear.  Wind shear means that as you move upward through the storm, the wind direction and speed changes.  For example, the wind might be blowing west at 80 mph at one altitude, but if you go a few hundred feet up, it's blowing northeast at 100 mph (as an example).

This wind shear causes the air inside the thunderstorm to rotate horizontally, in much the same way that a tube of Play-Doh will rotate between your hands if you slide your hands in opposite directions.  A strong updraft (upward moving air that feeds the thunderstorm) can tip the whirling air tube into a vertical position, and voila!  You've got a tornado!

I hope that helps.  Good luck!
