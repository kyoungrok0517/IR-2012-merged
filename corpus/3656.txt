Different agencies guaranteeing the loan.  Different qualifications for getting a loan.  All in contrast to a conventional loan or a jumbo or private loan without PMI.

VA is for military veterans only.  Very generous terms, generally higher fees over the life of the loan.

FHA is a federal guarantee for qualified applicants by income, house, housing area, and loan amount.  As with VA the approval terms are more generous, but the fees are higher.

PMI is required for conventional loans when the buyer (you) has less than 20% of his money in the deal as measured by current market value.
