Was Guy Pearce's wife diabetic.  And isn't it possible he, like the Sammy story he clings to, gave his wife too many injections?

There's a scene where we see him give her a shot.  Later, this is brushed aside with another shot of him playfully pinching her.  But it seems as if the first is a "real memory" and the second is his attempt to cloud the fact so as to avoid psychological pain.

So, like some French mysteries, the protagonist is really searching for himself.
