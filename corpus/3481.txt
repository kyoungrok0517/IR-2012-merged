Possible bacteria content:

"The Food Standards Agency say, "Don't give honey to your baby until he or she is a year old. This is because, very occasionally, honey can contain a type of bacteria that can produce toxins in a baby's intestines. This can cause serious illness (infant botulism). After a baby is a year old, the intestine has matured and the bacteria can't grow."

The British Honey Importers and Packers Association has advised its members to say on honey labels that honey should not be given to babies under 12 months.
