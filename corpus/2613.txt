Re: icevixen's comment, I think it would be best to say, "women WITH children first".  It was the social grace at the time, but now I think the most logical method would be to let those off least likely to survive on their own first.  Unaccompanied children, then children with their mother (women are still the primary caregivers of their children and are able to provide necessities males cannot), then the elderly and disabled and the already injured.  From there, you need to determine who would most likely survive.  As a whole (this is not a personal opinion) males are physically stronger and would weather minor injuries better and last longer in the water.  From there, I believe the women who felt they were the strongest/most able-bodied amongst the women should stay; and (as Sabrina K pointed out) those who have training and knowledge of the vessel that may allow them to survive longer and to assist those who don't).
