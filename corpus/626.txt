Dude is your friend dumb? Honestly I have the reverse problem where they are only there at night making poo and leaving ticks behind. My neighbor got lyme disease last year from a tick in the same area, the infection went to his brain and he is still partially paralyzed. God I can believe how #@*&^ some people are actually wanting the deer in close proximity to their home. Tell your friend to call an exterminator and have the area sprayed for ticks.
