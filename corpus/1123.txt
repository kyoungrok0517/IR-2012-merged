I really don't think you can compare any great athletes from different sports. Take Jordan he tried baseball he wasn't lighting it up as he did on the court. There have been players who have made the majors in more then one sport but they are not among the elite. Babe is from the 20's and 30's the others mentioned played there sports much later. The conditioning much better then Babe was but Babe was the greatest and world known. If i picked a contemporary I go with Gretzky because he redined playing the sport same as Babe did .
