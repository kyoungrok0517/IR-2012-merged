Well according to the history channel several things led up to its demise. One notion I can put to rest is the theory of the weak rivets. They didn't have a lot to do with the sinking. When they ignored the warnings for the icebergs they continued on trying to set a new record for an Atlantic crossing. By the time they saw the ice berg it was too late. When they impacted the ice berg they tore a hole in the side of the ship that caused it to take on massive amounts of water. However under normal circumstances it should have stayed afloat long enough for the rescue boats to get there and unload all of the passengers and crew. Well what happened is a portion of the bottom of the ship became detached and caused the ship to sink much faster than it should have resulting in the death of many people. It is sad but that is what happened. After thorough investigation then and now we now know it was not an engineering mistake. But a human error that caused the problems.

They did try to build water tight compartments however not all of the compartments reached the top so they would not be truly water tight. Once the water rose to a certain level it wopul eash into the next compatment. However  stand by my original answer.
