Right first things first, yes they do make your body seem more mature, but at an extremely fast rate thats dangerious to your body and its only short term.

Also because it is supplying your body with testostirone, your body thinks it doesn't need to produce anymore, so your scrotum shrinks. once you stop using them your testostirone levels will just drop to very low level stunting natural proccesses like growth.

If your that bothered about how mature you look, hit the gym and eat lots, put the work in and reep the benifits because cheating comes at a price :)
