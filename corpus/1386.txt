There isnt much of a safety difference between them, but there is a difference in how they fit and form to your head (and face). There are helmets that have more padding in the jaw area, and some that even have pump-up padding. The bottom line is, it has to fit your head properly and it should be fairly comfortable at the same time. SNELL approved helmets are the only way to go. They have been tested and proven better than just DOT approved helmets.
