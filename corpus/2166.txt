I just turned 19 years old and im losing hair like crazy. I've always shed hair before but now its bad because i can tell the difference in the thickness.  Also my scalp is itching some but I don't have lice, but is that a sign of symptom of any disease? I am stressed out a lot from school, family issues, & personal love life.  So that could be the problem but I just feel like I could have something else.  Its been a week since I've noticed my problem and I'm scared to even shower cause hair keeps falling out.  So since then I changed my shampoo from tresemme to pantene because i heard pantene helped make hair stronger and Im also now taking hair pills called hair, skin, & nails Biotim/Collagen/Gelatin cause I heard it makes your hair grow & stronger.  But my question what could possibly make my hair fall out? Any diseases or sickness that causes this? I'm scared I'm going to go bald before I'm even 20.
