The main thing to remember about most Japanese art of that genre is that it's printmaking, mainly of the woodcut variety. Get info online about print- making techniques, or a book from the library, read it up, then try experimenting by creating some prints of your own. Bear in mind that you have to start ' simple', and it might be some time before you develop skills you're satisfied with.
Most Japanese arts and crafts have evolved slowly and painstakingly, no ' instant fixes' for them, ha ha
