Retiring early, as in 5 to 10 years is not easy. It's a lot of work. Hence most people don't do it. 

If your up to the challenge:  
Spend a lot of time investing in yourself.
Read at least one non-fiction book each month: Boundaries, Integrity (both by Dr Henry Claude), Rich Dad Poor Dad, One minute millionaire, Millionaire Next Door, Millionaires Mind, Pushing Up People (by Art Williams), 21 Indispensable Qualities of a leader...  And so many more great books.  
Wright out your schedule every night  for the next day.
Set yourself a set amount of time for each and every task, if you don't, the task will take as much time as available.

What ever you decide to do for a living, make it work, dig in your heals and do everything possible to achieve your goals.  Have your goals for tomorrow, the week, the year, 5 years, 10 years and life goal.  

If your goal is to go sailing, that's great! But to end your life with sailing a boat, is pretty dry.  What will people remember you by? Do you want to make an impact on those around you, or your family? Why not own a business of some sort, and take a month or more off to go sailing in the biggest boat there is?

You see, your life time goal right now is sailing a boat.  Is that all you want out of life?
