I want to decorate my home with huge cylindrical and square lava lamps, and thougt tha polycarbonated cylinders could be perfect for the project, but I have no idea what tools I may need, what chemicals and quantities are recommended and what possible precautions to take. Can you help, please!  Thanks so much!
