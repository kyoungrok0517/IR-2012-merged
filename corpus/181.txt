Why would you say the world is starting to destroy itself - there is nothing happening now that hasn't happened in the past.
Of course, human activity is contributing to climate change and global warming, but that is hardly the Earth "starting to destroy itself".

The world is NOT getting really bad - you are obviously too young to have experienced "really bad".
