I LOVE my lava lamp! I don't leave the room long when I have it on, but I LOVE It! When I moved the first time I was unable to put it out, so it went 3 years without use, When I was able to use it again, I cleaned it off from all the dust, ran it for about 15 minutes just to make sure the bulb was working, then that weekend, I cranked that bad boy back up!!!!
