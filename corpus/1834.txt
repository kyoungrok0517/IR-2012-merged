These guys are right on the money. A glue on leather tip is far better than any screw on. If your lookin to buy a cue with a screw on tip then it probably isn't much of a cue. If your husband is serious about his pool game , even in the slightest , then he isn't going to care much for a cheap pool cue. I don't mean to be rude or harsh but thats just the way it is. What I would recommend is getting him a gift certificate and letting him go and pick out his own cue or whatever he likes. Just about any retailer that sells pool cues should also sell gift certificates. Good luck to ya.
