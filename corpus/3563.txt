Dangers from the sun....skin cancer, and 90% of your skin's aging happens from the damage of the sun.

Best option is self-tanner and bronzers.  Then sun block out in the natural light.

The one I use is Leg Apeel on the body and Secret Agent Tri-Color Bronzed Beauti for my face from BeautiControl.  There is a self-tanner in the product line for the face as well.  I just don't use it...but it is rated on sunless.com.
