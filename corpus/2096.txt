I currently share a vehicle with my sister. Needless to say it's a POS, but we can't afford a different vehicle.  Based off of some issues over the past week since the last time it was in the shop I decided to look at factory recalls on our specific model.

My mom initially bought the car five years ago and I remember her taking it in for a recall on some ball joint issue. It's been in the shop more then it's been driven, at least until my sis and I started sharing the vehicle.

Anyway, there were other recalls listed for about five items. Can I just take the truck to a certified Dodge dealer and ask about recalls... Like I said I really don't have the money for major fixes, but I know something is wrong with our car. I don't want to get screwed over by sounding naive but I also don't need to shell out the green for another car.
