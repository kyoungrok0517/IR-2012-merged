Amtrak has regular service on weekends.  It's a bit more expensive than MARC would have been, but it is also more comfortable and somewhat quicker--and it runs on weekends.

There's pretty much a train every hour, but check their website, particularly since many trains require an advance reservation.  When there's an Acela and a Northeast Regional train, choose the Northeast Regional train, unless you're on an expense account with money to burn.
