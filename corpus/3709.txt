I would not gain any extra happiness from gaining more material possessions. The thought of buying new clothes, new car or a new house does not especially excite me like it excites my co-workers.

The only new thing that would give me happiness would be discovering new music that would take me to previously unknown moods, atmospheres, and beauty or finding new stories to read by my favorite authors. However, these are not physical, material things, so I believe that I no longer have desire for the physical, material things that money could buy.

My question is: Does my lack of desire for material things show that I am on the road to spiritual wisdom, or am I just suffering from depression?
