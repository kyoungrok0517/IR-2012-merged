I know your getting bashed for this question, and I'm not trying to bash you but, please please please research it before you let your husband take them! An ex-boyfriend of mine took them and slowly turned into a scary mean mutant looking freak. When you read about them, you most likely won't want him to take it.They do alot more than build up muscles. They cause a lot of harm to the body. It's just not worth it. Really look into this first. I'm telling you from 1st hand experience, it's not cool. The hormone messes with them so much they can't control their emotions (or tempers) and the outcome isn't pretty. It could possibly end your relationship. Even if he is the sweetest kindest most gentle guy in the world, he could turn into a nasty beast. And that will be the least of your worries after you read what it will do to his body. google anabolic steroids and see what pops up. You'll get more insults than info from this site. You need facts right now, not opinions. Good luck and I really hope you look this stuff up.
Intelligent friendlist and Dave Joseph are right. Ignore improv, he needs to add an e at the end of his name, read it, then do it.
