Probably not.
The hair on the head is a different texture and diameter from chest hair.
Also, one has more follicles per square inch on the head than on the chest or back.
The graft taken from one area of the head and grafted to another site on the head will grow that hair like it had always been there.
Not bloody either like it would be from the back or chest and less chance of infection.
Very natural.
