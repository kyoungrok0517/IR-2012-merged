exercise help suppress your appetite by distracting you and making you feel lighter. BUT never over excerise, from my experience all you need is 60 mins at treadmill, 5.5 incline and 5.5 speed. Don't Jog!! Just a power walk.. and always insist!! Read magazines or something while you're on it.

I do use supplements as well to help me achieve better... I do eat a lot and it's hard to reduce my temptation for food and junk food. Here I read this review and actually tried it, not bad with the results, suppress my craving very well! Don't expect losing fat too fast, take it slow and just insist!
