The steroids that bodybuilders typically take are or act the same as testosterone, the male sex hormone. It increases muscle repair time, and increases the amount of muscle your body puts on. It also makes a person feel more energetic. (It's not actually an energy supplement, but bodies just work harder and faster when there's lots of testosterone around) It is not liquid in the muscles; that's creatine's thing.

Basically, it helps bodybuilders push past their natural genetic limitations, and put on more muscle mass than they would be able to with the amount of testosterone they produce naturally.

It's hard to say what the ill effects of steroids are, because there are actually very few substantial scientific tests that have been done; and there have been no long term studies done. Most people believe that steroids shrink your testicles, give you cancer, and make you super aggressive ("roid rage")  There are many steroids user who have developed cancers, but there are many who have had no ill effects whatsoever. In terms of "roid raging," it depends more on the person rather than on the fact that steroids are used. Just like smoking, (although with far less evidence) there are hardcore users that never have an ill effect, and dabblers that die from it. There is a general agreement though that taking steroids during the developing years (around puberty) can have very bad effects on the body.

I'm actually not sure why it's illegal. Substances such as nicotine and alcohol are widely available; caffeine is entirely unregulated. All of them in high enough doses can cause immediate death, yet all are legal.
