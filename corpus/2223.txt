Anabolic steroids are not necessary if your diet and exercise routine are right for your body. My guess is that you may need to make some alterations in your diet. What is your ratio of proteins, carbs, and good fats? Protein is crucial for building muscle mass. Carbs are great for short bursts of energy, but not long-term muscle development. Also, the carbs must be complex carbs, not simple carbs. You don't need an excessive amount of carbs unless you are doing a lot of cardiovascular activity as well as body building. You should be alternating weights with aerobic activity anyway. If you aren't, you probably aren't burning enough calories on a daily basis. Be sure to include stretching exercises, yoga, or some activity that helps with flexibility as well as strength. Body builders can get so bulked up that their actual range of motion is severely limited. This can cause joint, tendon, ligament and muscle shortening and injury.
Good fats include olive oil, flax seeds/flax seed oil, avocados, oils in nuts such as walnuts, almonds, pecans, etc. (raw, nut roasted and salted), fish oils, as in salmon. 
Don't eat after 7:00 p.m. unless it's protein. Avoid anything with artificial sweeteners or high fructose corn syrup. 
Steroids are dangerous!!! They must be broken down by the liver and filtered through the kidneys. Prolonged use will cause liver and kidney damage and eventual damage of the heart and other organs. Regular use also causes hormone changes and can cause infertility. It also causes behavioral changes, such as aggression and violence. 
I speak from experience. I went through this with a boyfriend once. It ended a three year relationship. It isn't worth it!
