NO you cannot breed Savannahs with Bengals - you will get a non registerable cat.  TICA is the ONLY association to recognize Savannahs presently.

And according to their standard these are the ONLY allowable outcrosses:

PERMISSIBLE OUTCROSSES: Serval,
Egyptian Mau, Ocicat, Oriental Shorthair,
domestic shorthair not a member of a
recognized breed).

I WILL tell you that you won't find a reputable Ocicat breeder allowing you to use their cats in a Savannah breeding program.  We do NOT want wild cat blood in our lines!  I'm sure the Mau breeders feel the same way.

Andy (below) - I have no idea where you got your background info on how a Bengal and Savannah were created, but you should read the history and background - you are not correct for either breed.  The Aby was NEVER used in the Bengals and the Siamese was NEVER used in the Savannah.
