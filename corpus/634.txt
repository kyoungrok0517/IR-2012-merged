In a lifetime of hunting I have found a full moon to have no effect on deer movement. There are times there will be almost no daytime movement even in the dark moon phase. People just seem to want to blame something for the lack of deer movement. And the moon is a good scape goat.

 Two years ago on my hunting lease while bow hunting 3 of us killed a deer and one did not even see one. His excuse? He pointed to the sky at the full moon and said that was the reason he saw nothing. I didn't have the heart to remind him there had been 3 deer killed that weekend already. It's human nature to want to blame something.
