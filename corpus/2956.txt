That's funny.  I thought I was the lowest form of bacteria that existed when I went through Marine Corps boot-camp. Then as life went forth I learned that I am lower than that.  Oof.  It was definitely interesting when I learned that I am denser that a rock.  No wonder I fell to the bottom of the cesspool.
