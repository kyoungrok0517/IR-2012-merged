any one responsible for other people should sacrifice for their charges. whether it is women, men, rich, or poor, if you accept the responsibility of being a leader, sacrifice is a part of the job requirements. i just don't feel that the women man dynamic has much to do with anything. honestly i would feel guilty that someone died for me.
