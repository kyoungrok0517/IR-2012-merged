What these two doxies have in common is a genetically inherited disc disease (IVDD). They went thru a lot of pain when the disc ruptured. It took 6 weeks of bed rest (ha! trying doing that with a dog). Now their owners who love them dearly devote extra time in caring for their special needs furbabies.

Because doxies have genetics to predispose them to  slipped disc problems (IVDD) it is so important that reputable breeders understand and endeavor to breed correctly to eliminate this horrible disease in their litters. I just read that 1 in four doxie pups get IVDD! Who knows how many doxie mix pups. How can this possibly  be?

Reputible breeders keep track of traits, which generation had what and breed only when the pedigree (a list of the dog's ancestors) indicates a good healthy pup, meeting the breed's standards will be produced.  Skillfull breeding is a profession not a hobby as you can see.  It takes a lot of work and knowledge.  That is why so many doxie pups from "backyard" breeders inherit IVDD. The symptoms for IVDD unfortunately do not typically show up til 4-6 years old.  By then a backyard breeder who doesn't keep track of genetics doesn't know what they are breeding.

Make sure you have a copy of this important document in *your* pup's folder. In case of emergency you need to know ahead of time what the symptoms are to avoid paralysis.  It's hard to think clearly when your pup is hurting, so  having this info handy will help you make good decisions and quickly.
