I'm pretty sure these guys bloom in late winter/early spring.  Their blooms probably wouldn't last until November.  However, some growers that use greenhouses and who can control lighting, temps, etc... can bloom plants out of season.  I'd do some searching around and see what you can find.  You may end up purchasing pricey out of season blooms, but then again I may be wrong and you'll find some blooming during November.  I'm a phalaenopsis grower, not dendrobium.  Goodluck!
