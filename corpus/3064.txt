Well earth's water came from a few different sources but scientists say most of it may have come from asteroids and comets that contained water in the form of ice when they crashed into Earth early in its history. Water was also outgassed by volcanoes. When the earth cooled down enough water vapor turned into clouds in the atmosphere and rained down all the water, forming oceans.

The atmosphere on Earrh has existed since it formed because earth has a strong enough gravity to contain one. However, it wasnt always composed of oxygen and nitrogen. In fact before the rise of photosynthetic organisms it was mostly toxic gases releases by volcanoes, and a lot of carbon dioxide. But since the evolution of photosynthetic organisms these toxic gases have gradually been replaced by oxygen.

You can confirm all this info by doing a google search of how earth's water and atmosphere came about
