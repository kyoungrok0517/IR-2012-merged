I think almost any music causes stimulus and therefore exercises the brain. We tend to seek those types of music that we are most familiar with and most comfortable with.

When I was in my teens I listened mostly to only one type of music. But as I've grown quite a bit older I have come to appreciate everything from rap to heavy metal to bluegrass to classical, etc.

Variety will cause your brain to find new ways of listening and in the long run exercise it more and make you more appreciative of various musical aesthetics. It really is good to like many kinds of music, since there is so much out there.
