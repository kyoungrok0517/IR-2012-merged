Here's the simple version:  Don't buy a house unless you will live in it for at least 5 years.

Here's the slightly longer version:  Get some help from someone who can talk to you directly, because you so completely misunderstand the purchasing process that I'm very concerned that you are going to end up in a bad situation with your purchase.

Here's the much longer version:  Let's say you buy a house for $100,000.  That's 100k.  (k=thousand).  Your closing costs will be about 5k.  Those are the costs to buy the house.  (Lawyer, inspector, etc.)  So you need to pay 105k to buy the house.  You put down 10k down payment.  You get a loan for 95k.  (95+10 = 105)

Over the next 5 years, you pay your monthly mortgage bill.  Most of this money goes toward paying interest on the loan, so your loan balance (the amount you owe) doesn't decrease much.  So after 5 years, you owe about 90k.

You decide you want to live in an apartment.  You sell the house for 100k.  About 8k goes to the realtor and for closing costs.  So you get 92k  (100-8=92).
The bank takes 90k to pay off the loan, leaving  you with 2k.  Two thousand dollars.

Did I mention that during those 5 years, you are paying for all repairs to the house out of your own pocket?

Let's say you don't keep the house up so well.  You sell the house for 95k.  8k to realtor and closing costs, leaving 87k (95-8=87)

The bank takes that money and wants an extra 3 thousand from you to close the loan, or they won't let the deal go through.  You owe 90k, and with 87k net from the sale, that leave 3k for you to pay.
