There are fault lines here and we do have them occasionally, had one a bit north of here a few months ago.  But they are usually quite small in comparison and rarely felt by people.  Nothing in Denver's geography would make the quakes felt more strongly here than elsewhere.  It's all based on magnitude, not altitude.
