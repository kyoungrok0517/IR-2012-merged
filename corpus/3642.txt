I have built a condo complex in Atlanta, GA. It contains 8 units and we have sold 5 units. I need to get my condo complex FHA approved. Can someone explain the process to get my condo complex FHA approved since we have  one unit under contract and the FHA loans are very attractive. I have heard of spot checks which is really quick. Please advice and provide recommendation.
