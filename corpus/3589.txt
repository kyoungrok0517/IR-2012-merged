Im a lad and i use them here and there. depending on how you burn on holiday depends how long i go on the sunbeds for. I go quite brown and dont burn that easily so for it to look like i have been on the sunbed and for it to look like the sunbed has made a difference i go on for 9-12 mins. If i were you i would start off on about 6 mins and go on once a week/every other week until august is nearer the time.

You will then get to grips with how many mins makes you look a shade browner.

for 4 weeks before you go on holiday i would up the time until you feel comfortable with your PRE-holiday tan. Remember you only want to look acceptable around the pool. Then once your on holiday you can get your real tan.

Hope this sort of helps.
