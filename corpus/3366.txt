Some may have heard before about the so-called Club featuring artists who died at the age of 27. 

Granted, it is morbid, but there are several artists who died at that specific age, which gave rise to the idea of the "Club".  

I can name at least 5 famous music artists who did die at that young age (but I won't until the question is over!). 

How many can you name? There almost definitely are more than the five I can name right now off the top of my head. 

Again, it may be morbid, but it IS interesting. 

Thanks!
Thanks, Baldini!
