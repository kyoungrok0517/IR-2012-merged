No, no, no.  Honey is very bad for babies under a year because of bacteria.  Besides the honey your baby shouldn't even be having bread at this age.  Just stick to breast milk or formula, baby cereal, baby fruits, baby veggies, and baby meats.  After a year you can experiment.  Whether honey is in the bread or not it is still honey.  You don't want to give your baby anything too early because of a higher chance of developing allergies.
