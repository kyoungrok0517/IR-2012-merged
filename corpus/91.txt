Hoodia Gordonii is a plant from South Africa that has a P57 molecule in it that tricks your brain by sending signals to it that tell it you are full.  Taking it daily (as long as you keep taking the same amount every day and don't skip days and such) will safely make you want to eat smaller portions, and completely get rid of snacking (even if you have low willpower).

Just make sure to do your research on the brand of hoodia you choose, because a lot of companies are fraudulent and do not contain 100% pure hoodia (heck I bet this thread will be spammed with tons of spammers promoting the fake companies).  Rather than giving you a link that I make money off of for referring you (like everyone else it appears on yahoo answers), I am going to be honest and say I bought it directly from their main site (purehoodiax.com) because my friend recommended it to me because it was working for her.  I haven't received my bottle in the mail yet so I can't give you a 100% honest personal answer, only my friends recommendation that I felt like I could pay it forward.  I recommend you do your own research and hope you find a brand that works for you if you do not take my friend's recommendation.  Good luck!
