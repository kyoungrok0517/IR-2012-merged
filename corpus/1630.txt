I want to compile every Nirvana recording that exists that is available (live perormances, studio recordings, home demos, alternate versions, rare songs, etc.) and put it on an iPod. I keep finding different songs in different places, mainly on You Tube and other places. 
Is there anyone that has compiled every Nirvana recording available?
Can I download all of those songs and put them on an iPod?
