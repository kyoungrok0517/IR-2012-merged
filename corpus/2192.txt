There's no appropriate age. But if there were it would be at least 20. Your body is done growing at 20, so the negative effects that steroids have on growth and development (such as small testicles and small penis, keep that one in mind) would be kept to a minimum. But premature hair loss and increased risk of early onset of heart disease would still be there. There are way more negatives than positives that come with steroid use. Stay away from them.
