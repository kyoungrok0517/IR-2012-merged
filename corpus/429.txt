The story in the Quran:

They said "So long as Moses does not come back we are not going to give it up, and we will remain devoted to it." (91) But (Moses) said: "O Aaron, when you saw that they had gone astray, what hindered you (92) From coming after me? Did you not disobey my command?" (And Moses pulled him by the hair). (93)

 "O son of my mother," (Aaron cried), do not pull me by my beard or my hair! I was really afraid you may say that I had created a rift among the children of Israel, and did not pay heed to your command." (94) Moses asked: "O Sameri, what was the matter?" (95) 

He said: "I saw what they did not see. I picked up a handful of dust from the messenger's tracks and threw it in, for the idea seemed attractive to me." (96) (Moses) said: "Go hence! All your life you are (cursed) to say: 'Do not touch me; and a threat hangs over you which you will not be able to escape. Look at your god to whom you are so attached: We shall verily burn it, and disperse its ashes into the sea. (97) 

Your god is only God. There is no other god but He. His knowledge extends over everything." 

91:20
