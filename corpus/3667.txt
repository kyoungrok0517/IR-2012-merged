i'm exactly like that too, i guess that when your depressed and sad, it just makes you want to be more descriptive with words, and just getting out the way you feel because well... i do that because no one likes to listen to me it feels like... so i try to explain to myself whats happening, and alot of times things about depression, lost love, relationships are very relateable to many others. 

i myself write poetry and songs, and i get my inspirations, or all my songs and stuff are about my life, and what i'm going through.
