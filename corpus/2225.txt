Jeez. Lots of bad answers here. Are you a man or a woman? The avatar looks like a woman.

Steroids CAN get you cut. Steroids CAN burn fat incredibly fast. And steroids do NOT make men and lesser men. The DON'T have long-term side effects unless you're a Serious abuser...

However, you probably just need more cardio. How much cardio are you getting? You need to keep your heart rate up for 30 minutes. Do this 4 to 5 times per week (if you aren't already) and you'll start noticing results after a couple of weeks. It takes time, but you'll burn the fat...

In the end, you should just BE who you ARE. You'll never be perfect no matter how hard you try. Nobody is perfect. Be as good as you can be without killing yourself. Nobody should expect any more than that... If they do, they're not worth your trouble..
