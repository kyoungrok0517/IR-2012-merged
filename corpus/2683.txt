-- To all those seeing she just wants to start trouble or rant, you clearly didn't see her first sentence "I pretty much know what which way I will go, but I just wanted to see if there is anything else out there I haven't heard of." --

I think you're right, you've put a lot of thought into it. I don't see how people can research it a lot and come out thinking it's a good idea. I wouldn't do it either if I had a son. 

I think looks are subjective (I prefer the look of a non-circumcised penis, so I think it's more to do with what you're used to) and it's just wrong to do cosmetic genital surgery on a child anyway, you don't know what their preferences or their partners' preferences will be. 

I wasn't swayed by the health benefits either as there are conflicting studies showing the lack of benefits, not to mention they are outweighed by the complications. And obviously if you remove a body part it won't have problems...but we don't remove noses to avoid snot, do we? Besides, it is easier to take care of an intact penis on a baby, as you've noted, than it is to take care of a circumcision wound.

Also there are more complications than just infection, the risk of it going wrong somehow and needing corrective surgery is quite high.

Recognising the fact it should be the boy's personal choice himself is something a lot of people don't think of, so it's good you considered that too!
