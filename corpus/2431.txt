After retirement the risk factor is important.Commonly used formula for the risk factor is, deduct your age from 100 and the balance is the risk factor percentage. For example, if age is 60 years, deducting from 100 is 40, so he can take 40% risk. One can invest as he wises, but risk factor is to be taken care.
