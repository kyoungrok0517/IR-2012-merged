I live in CT too and the deer have wreaked havoc in my garden.  Problem is deer will eat almost everything if they are hungry enough.  I would need to know if it's for the shade or sun to give you precise picks.  Some things in my yard that they haven't yet touched are astible, irises, montauk daises, black eyed Susan's and cone flowers.  Your best bet is to go to your local nursery and ask them.  They will ask you how much sun you have and give you advice on what to plant.  All perennials need to be taken care of so ask them what you need to do to keep them healthy.  Good luck.
