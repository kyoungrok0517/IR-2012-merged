Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by smoking, known as tobacco disease, is a permanent, incurable reduction of pulmonary capacity characterized by shortness of breath, wheezing, persistent cough with sputum, and damage to the lungs, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smokers have a 25% risk of developing COPD.

The chronic cough associated with smoking is largely due to paralysis of the small hairs which sweep mucus and debris out of the lungs (the mucociliary escalator) and up the windpipe to the back of the mouth, from where they are swallowed. Impairment of this system means that mucus collects in the lung bases, and the "smoker's cough" is an attempt to clear this. It cannot be treated, but tends to resolve if the smoker can quit.
