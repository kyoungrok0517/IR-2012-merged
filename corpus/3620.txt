im my company magazine it says using a sunbed once a month increases your risk of skin cancer by 50%

now if that was me that is enough to make me never ever ever ever want to use a sunbed.id rather be pale and interesting than have skin cancer- you could try a fake-tan for sensitive skin theres so many to choose from,st tropez is brill i swear by it
