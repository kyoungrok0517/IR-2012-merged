It can be seized.  Buying it for another person means you lose control of the asset, and ultimately, the courts could view that you intent was to avoid creditors.  A Trust could be an option.

Segregated Funds have creditor protection as long as you have a preferred beneficiary, and you purchase it long before you file for bankruptcy.  The underlying investment in the Seg Fund investment can be guaranteed interest terms or it can be a Mutual Fund if you are looking for greater potential returns.  

Now, in your case, you intend to file for bankruptcy at some point, that will pose some issues.  You may want to consult with an Estate/Tax Lawyer, but from my understanding, if your intent was to avoid creditors because you knew you were filing at some point for bankruptcy, and the Courts/Creditors can prove that intent, then the creditor protection under the Insurance Act for Life Insurance or Segregated Funds would not protect you.

There are several court rulings that a Lawyer could look at to advise you.  The Royal Bank of Canada vs. North American Life Assurance Co. and Ramgotra (1996) 132 D.L.R. (4th) 193, also known as the Ramgotra case comes to mind of when creditor protection under the Insurance Act did not protect the assets.

Talk to a Tax/Estate Lawyer to learn your options.  I don't think you should rely on the Forum for a solution.
