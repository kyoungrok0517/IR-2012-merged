well you are entitled to your opinion.  I think that forsure the children should go first.  But not necessarily the women over the men.  If I had a husband and child, I think that I would want to save my kid fist.  But I dont think that I could leave my husband if he had to stay back.  But who knows what would be going through your mind in a life and death situation like that.  Maybe you would be rational and thing about who should go first an get to live.  Or maybe you would just make sure you and your family were safe, regardless of the situation around you - its sounds selfish but i guess ultimately the only thing that is important, when there is a life and death situation, is that you and your loved ones are safe.
