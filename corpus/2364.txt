1. Just a guess but I'd say that the underlying rock is fragmented and quite possibly unstable.

2. Again a guess - It is believed that earthquakes are caused by tectonic plates grinding against each other as they constantly shift around. Regions where these plates do not touch shouldn't have earthquakes.

3. My guess is that these states are located on the center of the major tectconic plate that makes up the landmass of N. America and as such are far enough away from the edges not to be affected.
