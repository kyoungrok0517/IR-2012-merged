Tips: There's no way to become a millionaire, unless you won the lottery or you can sucessfully file a lawsuit for a lump sum.
But I can tell you that most millionaires own their own businesses.

I make two suggestions;

1. If your Employer offers a 401(k) (particularly if they will match your contribution), invest as much as you are allowed. If you have an IRA, do the same. You can find retirement calculators online which estimate how much you need monthly. For eg; if  u're 30 years old, have $5,000 already, save $100 per month, and can earn 8 percent interest, you'll be a millionaire in a mere 51 years -- at the ripe old age of 81. The younger you start, the  less years you get stuck in employment.



2.By looking at your talents and abilities, I suggest you & your husband venture together to sell a great business idea. Most millionaires started as entrepreneurs . It takes a lot of sacrifice, but do something you love. Probably, u would need a small loan to finance a jewellery design, accessories design  business, or innovate an existing product.
Try using your own home as your workshop, and bargain commision deals with distributors that sell the same products to make yours accesible to the potential cutomers. Or, fix up  a stand for yor products at an open bazaar in your area. If u become a succcess story you can expand and sell your business when u're ready to retire.

When you start making profits, spare some money from your paycheck before you start spending it. Send it into automated savings account or  invest in high-yeilding stock.


Other rules to go the extra mile:
-set a bugdet and manage your money wisely
-Start clearing your debts
-Invest as much as you can in a retirement plan like 401K.
-Live cheap to put more money into retirement
-Have a more agressive strategy if you want to retire at the earliest age
