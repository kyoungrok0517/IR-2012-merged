First of all, the cops do not make liability decisions. Everyone thinks that, but it's not true. They don't determine fault for a civil matter, the insurance company does. Secondly, it's good to supply it, even though it is seldom what determines liability. The insurance company uses all evidence, which includes statements taken from everyone involved and witnesses, and seeing vehicles, etc. You can give it to them, but it won't be the only thing that's considered.
