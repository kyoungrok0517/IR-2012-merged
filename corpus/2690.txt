I just had a son a little while back and even though I was really set on having him circumcised I really wanted to look into it and I found what you have already listed.  After thinking about it, the cons, they don't know that they have lost sensitivity.  The only place that really comes in handy is in the bedroom and either way they will be satisfied and they won't think anything less of it because they have never felt it without the circumcision.  All I can say is that circumcision's are really easy.  I was with my son and held his hand at 1 day old when he got his done and most people say its torture but my baby cried only till I picked him up right after.  No kidding like 30 seconds.  At that age they don't quiet know the difference between pain and other feelings it all has to be learned.  And taking care of it is easier then every.  They used to have you do a bunch of cleaning and now they have learned that you really don't have to do anything to it.  All we had to do was put vaseline on it to keep it from sticking to the diaper and withing about a week it looked to be all healed up.  It was done and healed before his umbilical cord was! As to your comment about him doing it when he is of age, hun I know a guy that wanted his down at the age of 22 and it was not good.  He was in so much pain because it is a lot more complicated and it made it difficult for him to do anything.  Another thing is that because it is more complicated they didn't do suck a good job and lets just say it doesn't look very good. Good luck with your decision!
