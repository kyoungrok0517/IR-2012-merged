In my experience the effect of music on memory is real, but it's not limited to electronic music.

Since the last years of high school I have listened to music while studying (to drain out my friends having fun in the yard, and my parents watching talk shows).  I found that in University exams if I was having trouble remembering an answer that I knew I'd read about, if I could recall what was playing at the time I read that chapter the memory of what I was reading would flood back. Weird but true.

I think that is not unlike tricks other people use to improve recall of names and large numbers of distinct options, I've heard of people imagining their brain is a big house with lots of rooms and they put each of the items they have to remember in a different room, and when it's time to recall them they simply walk down the hall to that room.
