There is no yes/no answer.  It depends on:

1.  What state you're in.  In some states, the lender is stuck with the foreclosed home that secured the mortgage, and nothing more.
2.  Some states, it depends on the type of lien that is being foreclosed.  1st trust deed, HELOC, cash-out refinance.
3.  Even in states that will allow a foreclosing lender to seize other properties to satisfy the debt, the lender is usually required to use the judicial foreclosure process, which is cumbersome, lengthy, and costly.  Most lenders simply go with the default notice/trustee sale process.

Bottom line:  Yes, lender may seize another property.  But, whether they legally can, or will, is dependent on many, many factors.
