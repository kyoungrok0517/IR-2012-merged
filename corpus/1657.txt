There's an old Buddhist saying, "If you meet the Buddha, kill him." The truly enlightened do not advertise their enligthenment. If you utterly accept experiential reality and all its facets, then there's nothing to do but be. A part of the world, but not OF the world. Buddha nature is really a very illogical (in the truest sense) concept - it's not something you can reason or objectively understand. Maybe eat s'more of dem shroomies.
