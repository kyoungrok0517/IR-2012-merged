Ohio: the most american place in america. its typical mid-america. full of really typical cities, a bunch of colleges, malls and even more typical suburbs. its kinda part of the midwest, but not really. ohio is bitter enemies with michigan, probably because michigan hicks have really awesome accents.

lol @ the Michigan part

I love Ohio!
