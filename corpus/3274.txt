I have looked up hypnosis classes and failed to find any university based graduate program for hypnosis/clinical hypnosis or anything even remotely related. Some courses in psychology do offer titbits on hypnosis. But I was wondering if any of you knew about a full course in hypnosis being offered by any university.
