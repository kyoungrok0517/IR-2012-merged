Her discussions and way of thinking now cannot really be compared to what she must have felt like at the beginning.  No doubt she was in shock, not knowing what to do and probably thought that her advisers were making the best decisions for her - ie keeping it in the news etc.  Also having never been in that position before she was taking advice from all the officials around her.  Seeing a psychiatrist probably wasn't a good idea.  They don't always treat successfully, and just pump you up with sedatives and anti depressants.  I suppose the best thing for her at that time was to keep busy, go into auto pilot and keep her mind on stopping herself from giving up and crumbling.  A chat to a psychiatrist may in some ways have made her feel she was giving up.  This book is probably a good idea as she can reflect and put things into perspective more now that in the early days.  We all know that time is a great healer with any loss - the pain doesn't go away but it is easier to deal with after so long.  Until a body is found she will never give up and I admire her for that.
