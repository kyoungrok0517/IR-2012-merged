1. Most volcanoes form at plate boundaries. When two plates collide, one subducts (or sinks) under the other. The plate that subducted will reach down into the mantle and melt. The magma it creates rises to the surface and builds up directly under it. When the pressure is to much to contain, it releases it in an explosion. Some debris and ash may rain down back onto the landscape. This process happens over and over until it becomes large enough to become a mountainous shape. Others form at hot spots. A hot spot is a region of mantle that is hotter than others. It burns through the crust and creates volcanoes. This is what is happening at the Hawaiian islands. 

2. Magma and gases create such immense pressure in the magma chamber that it cannot hold any longer. It all rushes upward and escapes the surface as an eruption. 

3. Scientists cannot monitor how much magma is in the magma chamber or how much pressure is in it. This makes predicting volcanoes very difficult.
