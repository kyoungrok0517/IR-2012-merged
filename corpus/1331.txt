Hey iam having a sweet sixteen pretty soon. But I haven't gotten a place. My party will consisted of about 150 to 200 people. I need to find a place that is not only under $2000 and in/around newport beach california. Also, it has to allow food from outside of the venue catering.
Please help me people. 
I need to make my party fab.
Thanks. :]
