Only a doctor can run the necessary tests and prescribe whatever hormone replacement therapy you may need.  There are no hormone supplements sold without a prescription, at least not in the US.
All I can say is be careful and make sure you work with a legitimate physician who will take a full medical history.  HRT (hormone replacement therapy) can be good for some people, but has been known to cause cancer, particularly breast cancer.
As a breast cancer survivor, I cannot take HRT and just have to live with it.  I don't miss the periods, but I do miss a lot other things.  
It happens to all of us eventually.  A good pair of tweezers and a small personal groomer are part of my "tool box."  I have hair everywhere I don't want it and not enough everywhere else.
