You need to research windfall provisions at ssa.gov

I know that if you were a school teacher who was NOT paying fica/mc, this retirement would lower your SSA benefits.

When your benefits may be affected
The Windfall Elimination Provision primarily affects you if you earned a pension in any job where you did not pay Social Security taxes and you also worked in other jobs long enough to qualify for a retirement or disability benefit. 

For example, this provision affects Social Security ­benefits when any part of a person’s federal service after 1956 is covered under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). However, federal service where Social Security taxes are withheld (Federal Employees’ Retirement System or CSRS Offset) will not reduce your Social Security benefit amounts. 

The Windfall Elimination Provision may apply if: 

You reached 62 after 1985; or 
You became disabled after 1985; and 
You first became eligible for a monthly pension based on work where you did not pay Social Security taxes after 1985, even if you are still working.
