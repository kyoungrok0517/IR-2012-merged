Yes, I do,. especially with the pictures of the devastation currently being shown in Haiti. With the poverty and squalor, civil unrest and fighting elsewhere in the world should we not all start thinking less of the petty little irritations of our own communities and be thankful for all of our good fortune. Realizing wherever we are is best. If you  were to ask a Haitian today if they wanted choices of east or west,  temperatures, shopping centers nearby, accents etc would they be choosy?. No. Today all they would find important is food, water and shelter.
