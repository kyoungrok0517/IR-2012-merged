I strongly suggest that you search the internet under FUE(follicular unit extraction) and  the wood's technique before deciding which harvesting method, FUE or Strip Extraction Surgery,  is better for you. FUE is a newer  and less invasive but somewhat more costly harvesting method that  does not involve cutting with scalpels, staples, stitches and only a topical anesthetic is used. Also, the number of strip extractions can be limited by scalp tightness. FUE allows a more even density between the grafted and harvested areas because the harvested area is evenly thinned. Current research is along two lines: 1) propagating hair in the lab identical to the hair on the back and sides that can be transplanted and 2) injecting stem cells from the hair on the back and sides to rejuvenate the hairs on top that have thinned to fine thin vellus hairs so that they once again produce robust terminal hairs.
Good Luck!
