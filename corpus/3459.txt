Holmes on holmes is a waco way over the top contractor. Not to say he doesn't do an excellent job. I do believe he finds the worst of the worst to make himself look better then he Truly is.  You could mount a panel box in any axis you want. It only makes common sense to mount it vertically with the main breaker at the top.  Because usually the service comes in from the top close to the main breaker keeping everything nice and safe and neat. I think he just likes to be extremely different. after all this is Canada we are talking about here.
