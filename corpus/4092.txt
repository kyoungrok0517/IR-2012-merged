volcanoes are basically vents from which magma is forced up into the surface.

describe one eruption:

Mt St Helens, 1980
this eruption was a lateral blast meaning that the magma blasted out from the side of the volcano which was the most amazing eruption ever not in terms of energy produced however as krakatoa, pinatubu and vesuvius have produced greater energy.

the resulting blast lead to pyroclastic flows, lahars and flash floods.

it is difficult to produce when a volcano will erupt because as yet we do not understand the amazing forces which drive the inside of the earth. there are many factors which can help us predict eruptions however this does not give us any firm evidence. such as buldging- deformation of rocks like what happed at Mt St Helens.
