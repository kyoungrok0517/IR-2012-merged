Mexican food is a mix of mexican indigenous and spanish gastronomical traditions, it includes even french and arab influences, we use the autochthonous ingredients like corn in all ways, a great chile variety, some authentic herbs, beans, fish, seafood, fruits (chirimoya, capulín, guayaba, zapote, changunga, garambuyo, etc.) and vegetables like chayote, calabaza (zuchinni and its flowers), tomatoe, green tomatoe, etc., some insects in some places, and from Spains influence we use cheese, milk (almost all our typical desserts are almost the same than there, like natillas, flan, arroz de leche, etc.), pork, beef, chicken, wine, rice, vegetables, coriander and parsley, wheat bread (bolillo, telera ant the typical pan dulce). Mexican influences in the world are vanilla, chocolate, tomatoe for exemple.
Spáin has a big arab inflence in its food (the use of rice, legumes, olive oil, olives, nuts, citrus, etc.) and of course we have their influence (and  here there is a considerable libanese population).
 And the globalized world has french, italian and "american" (their tastes) influences in their gastronomy, i think. Im mexican.
