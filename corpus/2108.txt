There's 2 kinds of recalls, government mandated ones and factory recalls.
Government ones are when the government finds out about an auto manufacturer's safety issue and mandates the recall.  The factory recall is done by the manufacturer when they realize that a bad part will get them sued and they will lose millions.

Otherwise, manufacturers prefer to simply let the bad parts continue to circulate out there and they will bear the criticism.  It has to cost them a certain amount of money and deaths of people before they will initiate a recall.
