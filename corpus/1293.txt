I'm traveling on vacation to Reno next week and staying Tue - Sat.  Any suggestions on fun things to do aside from the Casinos?  I love history and sight seeing about so any suggestions would be great.

Secondly, which casinos are the best to play at?  I am talking biggest generous payouts.  Staying at the Eldorado...

Thanks.....
