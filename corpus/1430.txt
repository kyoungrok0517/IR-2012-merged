Sorry bud - but they're not the same thing. Many riders wear those older style "rain bucket" helmets with separate goggles or glasses. That said - I think the cop could have let you slide on one. 

You could talk to the DA and tell him/her that you had forgotten your helmet and that it is a full face type with shield, perhaps they'll let you off on the eye protection violation. 

In the future, wear a helmet just because it's the smart thing to do, not just because of the law.
