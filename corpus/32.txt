We were looking at a Burmese for sale cheap, because she has a deviated septum.  We're not looking for a show cat, just one that doesn't cause allergies.  What is it about Abyssinians and Bengals that doesn't trigger her allergies?  A different kind of dander?  Do Burmese, Chausie, or Somalis share this trait?
