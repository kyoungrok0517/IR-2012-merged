We know all spiritual masters resorted to fasting. Is it a way to tame the ego? 

Jesus's 40 days fast. 
30 Days Ramadan fasts for Muslims
Budda and Moses Fasted regularly
Abdul Kadir Gelani fasted 

So what is up with fasting??? Can it also be a solution to depression? Can it EVEN energize the body? 

Thanks very much for answering. Peace, Love and Blessings!
