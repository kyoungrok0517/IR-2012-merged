Ok-

For Cambodia, I found a site that has famous women authors from Cambodia. You need to join the site to read the entire article about these three women, but the teaser has enough information to see if this might work for you.

For Thailand, I liked the interview with Dr. Pusadee Tamthai, which I linked below. She sounds great. (link below)

For Laos, I liked the speeches of Ms Onechanh Thammavong, a Member of Parliament. (in Laos) She's given speeches for the UN. (I linked her speeches below)
