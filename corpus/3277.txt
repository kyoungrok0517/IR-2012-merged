In Pokemon Diamond Hypnosis has 70 accuracy. In Pokemon Platinum Hypnosis has 60 accuracy. So, what accuracy will Hypnosis have if a person using Pokemon Diamond battles a person using Pokemon Platinum?
Smogon, Bubepeida, and GameFAQs are where I found out Hypnosis has 60 accuracy in Platinum. No one has really answered the question yet.
