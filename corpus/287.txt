If you choose to fast it needs to be something that is only between you and God.  Not because someone told you to.  A lot of times fasting can help you hear/receive God's message more clearly b/c you are listening/waiting for it. Fasting should be a time of prayer and commitment to Christ... and most of all something that you pray about before hand.  Only do it if you feel you heart is in the right place... not just for your benefit.  Be prepared for Christ to show you what He wants to show you, not what you want to see.  His will is most important, so be sure you are fasting because you want to receive His will.
