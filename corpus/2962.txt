Gotta say, I've had *completely* the opposite impression. They're bending over backwards to be so unbiased that it's ridiculous.

I honestly think democratically elected governments need to be held to a higher moral standard than terrorists. Don't you?

Where is the outrage when innocent women, children and babies are being blown up in a campaign that can do *nothing* more than increase sympathies for Hamas in the local communities? It'll increase future terrorism, not make peace more likely!

I think CNN should take a stand and not pretend that what's going on is morally defensible in any way. Israel is supposed to be the good guy, they're the western democracy and it's about time they're held to account to the media. But they won't. They'll keep playing impartial as babies die.

Shocking.
