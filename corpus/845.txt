Spanish food has had more impact on Mexico than Mexico has had on Spanish food.
The Spaniards eat lots of seafood and lots of red meat and lots of cured meats and sausages. The same cured meats and sausages that are popular in Spain are just as popular in Mexico: chorizo/longaniza, blood sausages, cecina, chistorra, ham, etc. Also Mexicans love seafood, red meats and chicken just as much as the Spanish.

Spanish food is about subtle flavoring with herbs and spices. Mexican food is about cooking something bland and smothering it with a mole; tomato/chile sauce; or lime,salt and powdered chile.

While the Spanish style meats and paella are very popular in Mexico the corn based products, mole and other hot sauces loved by Mexicans do not go over well in Spain.

Vegetable dishes are not very popular in either country. Vegetables are seen more as a garnish or something to add color or texture to a stew or soup. Fresh fruits are popular in both places.

In Mexico I like the tropical fruits, the mole and the tamales. In Spain I like the serrano ham, the olives, the oranges and the wine.
