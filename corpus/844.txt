There's a lot of overlap....

Mexican food is more Aztec inspired - tortillas, sauces, corn meal, moles, and spicy peppers. 

Spanish food is more savory, less spicy and includes more seafood. Paella, chorizo, empanadas, and other small dishes. But there is also overlap between Spanish food and Greek/Italian due to the Mediterranean influence, and this is component is less prevalent in Mexico.
