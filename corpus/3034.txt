Hi there,

Before you go under the knife you may want to try Rosehip oil, Vitamine E and/or Aloe vera.  Rosehip has been used to help maintain healthy skin for generations.  It has also been used to help reduce pigmentation and raised scar tissue.  I use it for ingrown hairs and the red blotches that the hairs can cause.  I buy it as an essential oil and apply it directly to the skin.

Cheers.
