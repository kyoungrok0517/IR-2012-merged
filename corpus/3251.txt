this depends on why your cat scratches. cats scratch things naturally to keep their nails in check, this will not stop by using feliway. Feliway mimics the pheromone scent of a lactating mother rather than their own cheek scent. The main thing that should be reduced when using feliway is things like scenting or spraying(peeing on things to mark them), over licking areas due to stress and any other symptoms your cat may have that relates to stress.
