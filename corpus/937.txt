Visiting srilanka doesn't mean against tamil people sentiments.
If we have to blame someone, then we have to blame ourselves for our politicians and people who voted for parties(all especially DMK,CONGRESS)for just money without considering about srilankan tamils in central election.
We tamils no need to create such a stupid show against Amithabh for just because he is visiting srilanka.
even already Amithabh make his sentence very clear about this issue and so its very unnecessary to give a hype for this.
