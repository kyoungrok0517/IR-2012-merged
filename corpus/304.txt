No, fasting is not a solution to depression.

No, fasting does not energize the body.

Fasting is used to demonstrate control over the physical urges and material world. Fasting without contemplation yields nothing. Fasting with a purpose, exerting our spiritual will over our physical body causes us to be more aware of our spiritual hunger through denying our body.

In other words, it is an ancient trick.

Will fasting help you with anything at all? No, but focusing your spiritual will does.
