Hmmm I'm not sure, I can say finding Mexican cuisine in Japan is quite difficult.  They don't even have Taco Bell there, at least the last time I was there they didn't.  To be honest, I don't think the Japanese know too much about Mexico.  When they think western countries they think the U.S. and England for the most part. However, my mother is Japanese (born and raised there) and my father is half Mexican.  There are defiantly people who are open to dating outside of their race. Most Japanese people (the ones that live in Japan) are not racist.  When they choose to stick to their own kind, it's more of a cultural thing.  When  they marry another Japanese they have more in common culturally.  Plus they don't see too many outsiders so most don't have a chance to date outside of their race.  There are many Japanese, especially the younger generation who are more open to having multicultural relationships.  And to most Japanese people, personality is the most important thing.  They like people who are respectful, responsible, and polite, since their culture calls for them to be very disciplined.  A Japanese-Mexican relationship could work, it just depends on the individual.
