An interesting question that, I am afraid, only scientists who have done research, can answer.

One little known fact about tornadoes is that they happen as a result of strong shear winds and that it happens horizontally first. It is then the mesocyclone; the big thunderstorm in the cumulonimbus above, that lift them as a vertical column.

Shear winds happen when the air is very unstable and moves in several directions in layers. Say, if two flow of air moves at right angle, some on the top will roll down and some of the bottom will roll up.

That creates a roller, a twister. One could think that a town with high buildings helps the unstability in the air and causes the start of such a roller. But then, it also adds drag and won't keep it stable.

Perhaps high obstacles in cities and mountains are the originator of shear winds, that become tornadoes when they move over a flat terrain, where they can form undisturbed.

As a light aircraft pilot flying in mountainous Norway, I can feel very well the "waves of the sky." I know how obstacles create turbulences and, in my humble opinion, can be the reason for the forming of a tornado. But they develop over a flat surface such as the Great Plains of the USA, you are correct!

I once saw, here in Norway, a light aircraft being lifted up by a twister and crash on the top of another aircraft in front of the hangar. We think that the twister was created as very unstable air passed between the two hangars.
