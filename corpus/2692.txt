This is a very sensitive subject. Everyone is going to have their own opinion on this and try to make you see it their way. Well their is no right or wrong answer to this. Every family has their own preference and reasons for doing what they do and they shouldn't be judged for their  decision!! If you don't want to circumcise then don't do it. Great for you and yours. If you decide to, then great too! And I'm so sick of hearing that its "mutalation". Its not!! If it was then it would be illegal and drs would go to jail for it. And their are risks no matter what you decide.
