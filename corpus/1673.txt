Sorry for the epic misread fail.

The other poster is right.  Ragtime would be a good place to start.  Scott Joplin is the most famous in the area.  The blues is also good http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_blues#Blues_around_1900  Also you could look up Vaudeville music http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Williams and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Walker_%28vaudeville%29  (the first recordings by black people were by them) Also useful: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Bolden   Sorry for all the links being from wikipedia.  I'm sure you can find more info on these people.
