Calcium Facts
Did you know…?

Calcium is important for maintaining overall good health. It plays a critical role in nerve transmission, heart function, blood-pressure regulation, blood clotting and other body processes, in addition to its bone-building benefits. 
99% of the body’s calcium is stored in the bones and teeth. 
High-fiber foods may interfere with your body’s ability to absorb calcium. Since these are often eaten at breakfast, it may be wise to take your calcium supplements later in the day. 
Adequate liquid intake is necessary for calcium supplements to dissolve in your system. For maximum absorption, be sure to take your calcium with at least 8 oz. of water, milk or fruit juice. 
Consuming too much caffeine may cause your kidneys to excrete more calcium than they should with your urine…calcium that your bones need. Try to limit caffeinated beverages to just two per day. 
It’s never too late to slow down bone loss due to calcium deficiency. The benefits of calcium supplementation for this purpose appear to have no upper age limit.
