There is a lot of false information out there about the usage of steroids.
***I am not talking about steroids for medical purposes***
What exactly makes it illegal? Obviously body builders use it, so is it legal then? It is so obvious they use it that I can't imagine it's illegal
What does it do to a man trying to be a body builder? I read it is actually liquid in your muscles???
