If you really don't have any writing or distinctive markings on the cue to start with, you might be forced to ask the person who gave you the cue what brand it is or who made it.  If they bought it from a store, you could ask which store so you could check on the maker, not to return it or see how much it's worth.  You don't want them to think that after they were nice enough to get you a cue.  Some cuemakers use distinctive joints or other building materials, but that's not to say that another cuemaker couldn't borrow the techniques of another.  The term "custom" is somewhat debatable.  I define a custom cue, as a cue that was made by hand by a skilled cuemaker and is either one of a kind or a very limited number was made.  I don't necessarily agree that a custom cue had to be made with a specific player in mind.  I'm inclined to believe that no real custom cue would actually have "custom cue" written on it.  Best of luck.
