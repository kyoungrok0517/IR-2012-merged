My mum has had alopecia and has been treated in the hospital for it- is your hair coming out in patches or is it male pattern baldness?
As you are very young they may consider you for help.
Some of the treatments that my mum had were injections into the scalp- this worked really well until mum had another personal trauma and she lost nearly all her hair.
At the moment she has been wearing a wig and has had a treatment which is really great and her hair has started to grow back. They paint on a substance which stimulates hair growth; it was discovered by working men who were using a glue and they actually started to see hair growth in the palm of their hands.
Good luck with finding out all the treatments available- I know it must be upsetting for you, miss jo.....
