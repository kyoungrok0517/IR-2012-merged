I lived in sunny southern California where it was not uncommon to find us frolicking in our pool on Christmas Day. We rented the house that we lived in which had a beautiful, large pool (approx 15' long x 8' wide ranging from approx 3' to 8' deep). The pool was unheated and even for California the water was rather chilly. Downright cold!! Since we did not own the home we didn't want to invest much money into any kind of heating system so we created our own "solar" heating system. We simply coiled black hose on the roof of the house which sufficiently heated the water run through it and into the pool. In addition we purchased a thick black vinyl pool cover which we kept over the pool whenever we were not using it. This attracted the heat from the sun and held it in the water. I, myself, was quite pleasantly surprised at and sufficiently satisfied with the considerable difference in the temperature of the water.
