you are only entitled to what is his base retirement based on how many years you where married to him, 10 years is the base line for that and he needed to be serving the whole 10 years and married. After that it works like a scale.... each year adding up to 50% at the normal retirement years of 20 years. My ex only got 37% for the time she spent with me even thought i retired at 20 years. Any benefits that are from disability are not part of the retirement and can not be divided as such. The retirement is considered an assist and can be divided. The medical is part of a disability and only awarded to the service person. She is not entitled to any of my VA benefits or my military disability only what is my base retirement.
