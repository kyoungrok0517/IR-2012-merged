I keep seeing all these perfumes with Pheromones in it For instance the first Paris Hilton perfume has it, and then theres one thats just called Pheromones but I don't know who makes it. Does this actually work?? I know that alot of guys like the scent of the paris hilton perfume but i don't know if it would actually work to attract someone does anyone?
