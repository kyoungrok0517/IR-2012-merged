All above are right. But there's something special to share.

I went to darjeeling last year & visited HMI- Himalayan Mountaineering Institute. There's a museum that tells the story of all himalayan attempts till date.

People there, told that two frozen dead bodies of mountaineers were found sometime back at few hundred meters below the peak of everest. Upon research it was found that they climbed in 1930. Their bodies were found  to the opposite side of mount everest (opposite to climbing side). There is a doubt that they reached the top & were returning. It is not confirmed yet. Research is on & the world record may change.
