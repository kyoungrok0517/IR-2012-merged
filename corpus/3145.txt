Thanks to the modelling industry we know what are the limits for a woman.  Female models have been becoming thinner and thinner and have reached a point where many of them seriously endanger their health.  Now it is said that a man can be considerably thinner without encountering serious health problems.  Some of the thinner female models have a bmi around 16.  What are the corresponding figures for a man.  At what lowest bmi would he still be healthy and at what bmi would he be seriously endangering his health?
