Enchiladas are always great, especially if others in your class are bringing authentic refried beans and spanish rice. 

They are easier to make than people think and please don't use "canned" enchilada sauce.  Make your own.

ENCHILADAS

ground beef
cheese
onion
chili powder
salt and pepper
oregano
cumin
cilantro
corn tortillas
flour
garlic
 
Mix beef with oregano, garlic, cumin, cilantro, chili powder, salt and pepper, and onion and brown.  Separate with colander, draining juices back into the skillet.  Reserve beef mixture.  Mix flour and water in a cup.  Bring juices to a soft boil.  Add flour/water mixture and additional water as needed.  Reduce heat to low.  Add salt as needed.  Dip corn tortillas in gravy, then place in cooking pan one at a time, filling with beef mixture and cheese. Roll up and place side by side.  When completed, sprinkle remaining beef mixture, cheese and gravy over tops of enchiladas.  Add fresh onion on top if desired.  Bake covered with foil at 350deg. until cheese is adequately melted.
