I agree with the other posted answers before your problem. You just have to work out on it. Try to rinse first the cans before putting it to the bin and be sure to empty it. Every now and then you need also to wash and rinse the trash can where you put on the cans. Lastly its very important to seal your bin with a tight fitting so that insects of all kinds will not visit it.
