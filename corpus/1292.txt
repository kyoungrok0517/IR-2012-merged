You might try contacting this site:

It appears to be the booking agency for The 12 Irish Tenors.  I didn't see any of their CD's available through Amazon or iTunes, but their agency would most likely love to sell their work.

Good luck!  If nothing else, that site also has a video of the group, complete with HotJohn.
