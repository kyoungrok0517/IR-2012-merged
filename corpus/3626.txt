What happens to an FHA loan when you move from a house to an apartment? Can you get out of your FHA loan and get the value you've put into it (principal) out? How does this work? Sorry, I'm new to this whole loan process. :)
I am not foreclosing. I am currently in an FHA loan, and am refinancing for a lower monthly payment (with closing costs paid by the bank). I just wondered what would happen if in a few years if I decided to downgrade.
