A lot depends on the months that you want to use the pool and where you live and if you will use a blanket on the water at night. Since you are using Celsius I guess Canada or Europe? Most heat pumps will heat a pool well down to about 10 C. Some with defrost will go close to 0 C. The best combination in the world is a heat pump first and then solar to take the edge off the water. Then you set the heat pump a little colder then the solar panels and try to let the panels do most of the work. Solar alone dissapoints many pool owners as it is not always reliable and if you live in Canada and many parts of Europe you might have a cloudy swimming season and not be able to swim when you want to. The speed to heat the pool is dependent on the size of the heat pump and how many panels you get. To give you more exact answers I nned to know more information about your pool and where you live.
