To be part of the Rose Parade you must have something to do with one of the organizations that make the floats. It is very competitive. There are many people who want to be on the float from each organization, but only a few can be chosen. Each year over 1000 local area girls try to be part of the Rose Court, 3 of my favorite teens are on it this year. 

You can watch the parade on route, tickets are $45 to $90 for the grandstands, it's free to watch from certain areas on the sidewalk (some areas you can't, private property, they sell grandstand space). Many people camp out overnight. You're not supposed to camp out until 12n the day before the parade, but people have been "hanging out" since yesterday and the parade's not until Monday! This is really early, so it looks like it's going to be a big crowd.
