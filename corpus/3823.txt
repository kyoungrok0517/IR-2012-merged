Jake............I was offered a barber/hairdresser apprenticeship in 1967 but I couldn't afford to take it. 1st year apprentice wages were $11 a week. I was earning ''big money'' in a clothing store. $15 for 5 days and Saturday mornings. My board was $10 a week and fares to work $2. Nineteen quid pre decimal currency was considered good money! I joined the Army in 69' and was earning $25 a week.

I understand your plight however. You could not live away from home on that income without the full support of your parents. A room in a filthy boarding house would eat up 60% of your income to begin with.
