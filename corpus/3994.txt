1) Christians: I'm confused. I just read that the camel was not domesticated until 7th century BCE, and that arab?
camel trade routes through southern Canaan to Egypt did not exist until that time also.

I'd guess your source is mistaken.  I've read - in a reliable historical text - that camel domestication existed long before that time.  Even Wikipedia offers real references to real studies on the topic that date camel domestication to the 3rd **millennium** B.C.E. - more than 1,000 years earlier than your date.


2) So how come the Old Testament mentions domesticated camels and arab trade routes existing during the time of Abraham and of Moses?

Answered.  Your source is faulty.  The establishment of "Arab" trade routes is inconsequential to most of The Bible - as most of The Bible does not concern itself with Arabia at all.  (one exception I recall:  the Queen of Sheba)  Most of The Bible is concerned with what is known as the Fertile Crescent - and trade routes throughout the Fertile Crescent are known to have existed in the earliest of historic times.  That is, our very earliest written records provide evidence of trade being carried on between, for example, Babylon and Egypt (and areas in between).
