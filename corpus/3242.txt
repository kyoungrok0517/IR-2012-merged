well first of all this isn't a zoology question, and yes they do we discussed this matter in my chemistry class. pheromones are a chemical sent that is released by the body. animals release pheromones when they are in heat, to attract a mate. humans, being animals, also release pheromones when sexually aroused. the pheromones that humans release are slightly different then animals, but when they are smelt they trigger a part of the brain, that provoke sexual arousal in the other sex.
