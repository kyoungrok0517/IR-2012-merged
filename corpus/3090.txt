Simply   The Entire Atmosphere contains 0.038 percent CO2...0.038 PERCENT.  that is 0.00038 parts of CO2 for (1) one part of atmosphere.   The best part is...it's plant food.  

Water vapor released from combustion comes down as rain.  It doesn't just disappear.  When water evaporates into a vapor.....It gets cleaner!  and falls a fresh water.

Don't listen to the wrong people...they just want more tax money and greater control over your life.
