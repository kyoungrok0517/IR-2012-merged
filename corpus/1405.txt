depends on the bike, but I have thin very reflective strips on the edges of my rims that make me very noticable from the side at night, as well as a very nice very bright set of HIDs. The rim things are just stickers and don't cost much, coruse' this is all for a sport bike, if you have a cruiser consider an neon tube next to your engine, they look sweet!

the helmet shouldn't make too much of a difference, it's more about the bike.
