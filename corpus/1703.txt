You can deduct medical expenses if they total more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income and you itemize your expenses instead of taking the standard deduction.
Example:
Your adjusted gross income is $40,000, 7.5% of which is $3,000. You paid medical expenses of $2,000. You cannot deduct any of your medical expenses because they are not more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income.
