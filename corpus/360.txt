Yes the second lender can foreclose, yes youu will have to pay off the first if you are the winning bidder, yes you will have trouble evicting the owner if they are current on the first loan.  If you only pay off the second loan and don't get title you will essentially become the second lien holder and will have to both evict the owner and you can't do that until AFTER you have paid off the first.
