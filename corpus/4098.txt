In literary terms, a conclusion has to do with what you have learned from the information inparted in a story or paper. In terms of your project, the conclusion would be the point where you tie everything together in a paragraph...a god conclusion will refer back to the beginning of your paper & show how you provided the proper information needed to support the points you set out to make by writing the paper...sort of like a summary with back-up...

As for a mountain range that volcanos have made; take a look at hte Cascade Mountain Range, located in the Pacific Northwest. Mt. Rainier, Mt. Baker & Mt. St. Helens (all volcanos) are part of this mountain range...

Good luck!
