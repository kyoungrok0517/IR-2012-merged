In gerneral, a male can be tested for both mtDNA and yDNA. A female can only be tested for mtDNA, and for yDNA results, for the best results, she needs a brother or her father to be tested.

Both the yDNA and mtDNA test work only in straight lines; the mtDNA tests the mother, her mother, her mother...and so on.  The yDNA test works for the father, his father, his father, etc.  

Neither will work in the zig-zag fashion.  E.g., in you case, you father can be tested for the yDNA, but it will not reflect his mother's DNA.  It will show his paternal grandfather, but none of the other 3 grandparents.

So, the autosomal DNA will do some good.  However, in my own case, it came up with one person who is my 8th cousin, twice removed, but it said he was my 4th cousin!  So, out of 10 matches, only one is an actual match.  (The one match, 8th cousin, twice removed, takes me back to the early 1600s in Connecticut.)

So, autosomal is the only one that might work.

As to expensive, well, most people can cut back on their smoke or booze and quickly pay for the test, or not eat out so often, etc.
