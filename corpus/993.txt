Isn't she a producer/director of her own company?  I would think she could create roles for herself that isn't as forgettable as the ones she's been in.  I have a hard time remembering the title of her movies unless someone tells me who the co-star is.  But to answer your question she doesn't have the skills to carry a movie by herself.
