You gave me best answer to your previous question with some commentary about my sarcasm and some questions. I will respond here since you like to talk but leave no email address where one can respond. You asked if I have a 3.5 GPA and the answer is no. I graduated with a 3.6 GPA from a NY University. I also have a 142 IQ. You say you are not "dumb" just "in love". I beg to differ with you. Anyone intelligent enough to comprehend subjects in a university enough to maintain a 3.5 GPA is indeed dumb if she thinks she "loves" a guy who has not only cheated on and left her but is continually in and out of jail. In fact, he does not "love" you either. Love is based on mutual respect, integrity, trust, admiration and a whole host of things that he has not shown you. Further, the way he conducts his life is proof that he has no respect for the law or other human beings either. You can lash out at me for my sarcasm all you want. I promise though, that one day very soon you will have to look back at this exchange and wish you had taken the advice of the many people who are appalled at your ignorance and lack of respect for yourself.
