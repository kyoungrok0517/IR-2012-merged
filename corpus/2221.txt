Steiroids will not get rid of fat whatsoever. Getting rid of fat is something that you will have to discuss with a personal trainer, or cosmetic surgeon as a last resort. You can get large muscles and a cut appearance without steiroids. All that steiroids do is allow muscles to grow to superhuman proportions. This idea is often appealing to younger men, but most women find it very disturbing. They prefer George Clooney to Arnold. 

Also, aside from being totally illegal, steiroids give you emotional disturbances (roid rage), weaken your bones, give you acne, and shrink your testicles. They are never worth the side effects.
