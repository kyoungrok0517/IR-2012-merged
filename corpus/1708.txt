I will be getting braces on in the next few months. Before I get them on my orthodontist has referred me to an oral surgeon because I have tmj pain ocassionaly and my lower jaw is also not right (it grew down too much and not long enough). What I want to know is what ways are there of treating jaw pain including non-surgical ways.
