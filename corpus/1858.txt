For a DNA test to come back negative, the sample would have to come from another man. I believe that for some DNA tests, they take a sample of cells from the inside of the cheek. So, the only way for you to fool the test would be to have another man's DNA on the inside of your mouth...I'm going to stop typing now because this is getting dirtier than I intended...
