I  am  dating  a  man  that  has  Parkinson Diease.  he  is  the  most  special  man  I  have  ever  met.  he  is  so  nice.  my  concern  is  will  his  Parkinson  Diease  get  worse.  I  have  talked  with   him  about  my  Ex- Husband  that  was  sick  with  a  diease.  while  dating  my  ex  he  took  very  good  care  of  himself.  when  we  got  married  my  husband   stopped  taking  care  of  himself  &  I  had  to  do  everything  for  him.  that  lead  me  to  believe  that  he  did  not  marry  for  love  he  just  needed  someone  to  take  care  of  him.  Do  you  think  if  I  married  this  man  with  Parkinson's   Diease,  I  would   end  up  in  the  same  kind  of  marriage  I  had  before ?
