I am currently in love with American University. I am interested in doing an early decision, therefore I am planning to make a $1200 trip there (I cannot go alone and I live in WA state -__-) sometime this summer.

Other schools I am planning to apply for:
- University of Washington
- University of the Puget Sound
- University of the Pacific
- Fordham University
- Seattle University

My GPA (unweighted): 3.43, in Full-IB classes.

By next year I will have a total of 6.0 math credits, and 4.0 credits in each of the other major classes (including language).

Accomplishments:
- 100+ hours of volunteer service
- 2nd in State First Aid/Emergency Response 2 consecutive years
- Secretary of German Club
- President of Emergency Response Club
- National Honor Society for 4 years
- IGNITE Executive Mentor
- Hobbies: guitar, horseback riding, reading, and drawing

I have not taken the SAT yet, I am taking in June then again in September. My PSAT score was 1600. I am hoping to get a 1800-1900 on the SAT by September.

Do you think I should apply early decision to American University? Also, do I have enough "backup schools," if they are considered appropriate backup schools for my statistics?

I am also heads-over-heels in love with George Washington University, but I am afraid that if I apply early decision to GW and do not get accepted, then my chances with AU would go downhill as well.

**Note: Due to scholarships because of my ethnic background, the cost of a college does not matter.

Thank you! :)
