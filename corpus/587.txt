I live in an area with a high deer population, but thankfully, have not had any accidents or close calls...  the thing to do if a deer, or any other animal for that matter, jumps out in front of you is to hit the brakes hard and hit them straight on... you will most certainly wreck your vehicle, but...  there is much less chance of having  a rollover, leaving the road or swerving into oncoming traffic.  We also have moose here, and for them the same idea goes except you are supposed to duck- they are so tall that they are basically a tank on stilts.  They  can come right through your windshield  at you.  Deer are much smaller and lighter, there is a greater chance they will just bounce off your vehicle and you have less chance of being injured if you brake properly.  Oh... and another thing...  it's a good idea to slow down and watch for animals on the side of the road...especially where  the signs are posted... even with all that, accidents do happen...you can't always control the outcome in situations like that.
