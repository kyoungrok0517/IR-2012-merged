so what did you guys do for halloween last night.. what kind of candy did u get?
i had fun. i went to my neighbors house for a halloween party. but most of his friends were from his school, so i didnt know very many people. he goes to a private school. after that i went trick-or-treating for a while. got lots of big candy bars. then went back to my house and watched the messengers. i like that movie, but i wish it were a little scarier.
