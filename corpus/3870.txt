I am a college student currently studying radiography and I am (or possibly was) set on studying radiation therapy after wards. I heard that a lot of radiation therapists are going blind?? I have no idea if this is true or not, I heard it through the grape vine from a friend of mine who is a sonographer and i'd like to know what kind of risks I would be taking from becoming a radiation therapist. thanks all!
