These are a few questions I need to ask of someone who actually takes care of Parkinson's disease patients (it is for my project at dental hygiene school).

1. Are there any psychological effects of Parkinsonâ€™s disease?

 

2. In your opinion, what are some special needs of PD patients?

 

3. What type of special aids or equipment do you recommend having in a dental office?

                                                                                                      

4. What is your opinion on sedation in the dental office?

 

5. Are you aware of oral manifestations from medications that are prescribed to PD patients?
