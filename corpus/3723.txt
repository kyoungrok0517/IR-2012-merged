can u not tell if u r happy or not?if u r happy u r not depressed.i believe we were meant 2 b abundant n whatever u desire.as long as it dosent hurt anyone else.if u have no zest 4 life and dont want 2 get out of bed u r depressed.there is nothing wrong with wanting or having things.but western civilazation definatly is very material.if u dont feel the need 4 much u will b easily satisfied and much less distracted than someone who is very needy.
