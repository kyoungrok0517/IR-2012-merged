If you want herbal approach, Kapikachu seed powder or Mucuna Pruriens seed (latin name) powder is the correct medicine. Take three times a day, start with 2 pinches powder, mixed with honey. go on increasing 1 pinch every week. If dose becomes larger, you may have vomiting sensation, headache or heaviness in head. Visiting nearby ayurvedic practitioner will be better as he can add a little ashwagandha owder (Witania somnifera) to the medicine, depending on pulse.
If you can get raw milk, or can take raw free range eggs, they will support the above medicine.
Both powders are so inexpensive that do not worry about cost at all. In India, one month medicine just costs 50 Rs or 1 US$.
