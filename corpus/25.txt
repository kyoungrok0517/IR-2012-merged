Other cats can also be marbled. Have you heard of the cat registry organization called TICA? They register all exotic cats. Do a yahoo! search and find their website. My mom and I breed Savannahs, which are part domestic cat and part serval. They are very sweet and they draw lots of attention. Most of the marbled cats like the bengals have tabby in their background. Do some searches and you will find many other cats that are marbled and domestic. Good Luck!
