Birth control pills regulate the amount of estrogen in the female body. Did her doctor put her on a low dose estrogen birth control Pill?

I have Endometriosis and it is actually controlled by me being on the pill continuously for 3 months, then I take a week off and back on for 9 weeks or 3 months. It seems to help. 

There are a lot of different pills out there for a lot of different reasons.

Something else she may want to try is called Estrosense, it's available at health food stores. It helps with pain and inflammation. It has helped my endo... Check it out.
