My father who is 71 years old suffering from parkinson since last 5 years. He is active, mobile,energitic and mentally alert too. Goes for morning walk, yoga and exercise daily since long. Right now his hand rather palm shakes not all the time but yes it does and at times he feels that he has to put efferts now to walk means now he drags his legs while walking, gets tired after some job. Couple of years back, he had high chelestrol level + high BP, so was on restricted diet he is loosing weight also is only 47 kg. Doctor say after 7 years parkinson takes bad shape He is on allopathy medicene and gets giddyness with that. I am worried about him please help me and is there any alternate therepy also...please advise
