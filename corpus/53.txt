Your going to need to use marine salt, not aquarium salt. The specific gravity should be about 1.015 when he gets older. Don't drastically change the salinity though, because a big change is worse than anything. He won't need an 80 gallon, 30 would be fine. Don't expect to keep much in there with him either. Puffers are really aggressive. Most, if not all puffers will refuse to eat flakes. Bloodworms are great, but you should stay away from the brine shrimp. Frozen brine shrimp have pretty much no nutritional value. To keep his beak from growing too long, just feed him a few live snails every week. None that are too big though. He's definitely going to need warmer water, 72 is not acceptable, get a heater for him. The temperature should be about 78-82 degrees.
