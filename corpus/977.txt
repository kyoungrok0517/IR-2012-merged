She's had a series of split-ups. If nothing else, trying to date others in her "peer group" (i.e., other entertainers) can be difficult when it comes to scheduling, prioritizing egos, etc. The relations than often work for decades usually involve one "star" with someone else whose schedule, ego, etc., has zero conflict potential -- and that's not the "normal" type she keeps looking to date.

In addition, as long as she's financially self-sufficient, there's not much reason to marry unless she wants to have kids.

I'd also expect her standards for marriage could be a bit skewed after her "complicated" marriage to Brad Pitt.

And she's expecting David Schwimmer to eventually break up with Zoe Buckman, so she's waiting for him. ;)
