I am very involved in the war situation in Gaza. While watching a news broadcast in CNN, it seems their news is unbalanced. They're statements seem very biased, showing facts only on Gaza's side. For example, they summarized the sequence of events of the situation in Gaza starting with "Israel attacks". They act completely oblivious to the fact that Hamas started the missile attacks days before. The sequence they presented is very misleading.

Also, CNN news constantly features stories of Palestinian woman and children wounded and dying. They present these stories by saying "While Israeli bombs create clouds of smoke over Gaza, Palestinians suffer with lack of medical supplies... etc." The way these stories are presented, from the choice of words to the tone of the reporters voice shows utter disgust for the actions Israel is taking to protect it's people and country.

I've heard that CNN has a reputation of biasing news in their party (Democrats) favor. News should be objective without opinion interfering, especially when broadcasting events as huge and important as these. CNN, being a main world news channel, should know this.

Does anyone else notice this bias?
