Time can "ease" the pain but i think the healing comes from our perception of the event in question... It can't heal until we change how we think about it.. If we relive it over and over in our minds as it happened and allow it to hurt us just as it did when it occurred, we give it the power to keep festering like an open wound. But, when we realise that everything we do in our lives was exactly what we were meant to do at that particular point in time and we understand that there is a bigger picture that we just can't view yet, then we will be able to start to heal... Everything happens for a reason..  The ability to forgive is very healing...  (-: 

That is one very cute and cool "blue" puppy... Thanks for putting up the photo of your baby... (-:
