So I read this book a couple years ago. I think the authors first name is Linda and the book was written with her doctor (psychiatrist?). She lived in South Africa and she suffered from major depression. She was hospitalized and went to partial outpatient care (she was in the hospital at night - I think - and home during the day). She had a son and a daughter and a husband. The beginning of the book talked about her driving home from the grocery store (or something like that) and she decided to commit suicide by driving her car of a cliff. She stopped and called her preacher because he said for her to call him before she attempted anything. She ended up in a hotel room and her husband had to come pick her up. That's all I remember. Can anyone help me with this? I want to find this book!
