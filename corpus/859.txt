First off - I'd like to thank the inventor of the tortilla, refried beans and the jalapeno salsa for bringing so much enjoyment to my face/stomach and endorphines.  That being said i am an avid consumer of anything involving mexican cuisine or culture.  I am an avid shopper at my local carneceria, attempting my feable knowledge of spanish and polishing my status as a polite, local and big-time gringo... but none the less, involved.  So my answer to your wonderful question is....I truely believe that between the simplicity, portability and over-all options - mexican food is one of my first options when i am hungry because i can be satisfied no matter my craving.  Spicy, sweet, healthy, fried, vegetarian and if i am feeling bold, i can even tap into the "fear factor" in me with dishes including raw octopus or fish heads.  I prefer to eat my mexican food in a relaxed environment with no hold barred influence around me.  I dont like the american version/themed restaurants, i actually prefer the ones i have to repeat my questions several times with hand gestures and spanglish to finally get my point across, i like the accordian, i'm okay with room temperature beer and even the akward stares from the "insiders".  I enjoy surrounding myself in a culture that has helped build what i know of an the United States.  we lack the culture and roots these people offer us.  Although my Colorado version migh be a watered down version of the latino variety, i still feel priviledged that I am allowed the opportunity to wrap myself with a culture that i wish was imprinted in my DNA.  Its not just the food - its a way of life.  We as american could learn a thing or two form our friends down south.
