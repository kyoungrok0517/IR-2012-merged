To be honest, I came up with an odd thought which linked global warming to a bad scenario. Humor me by picturing the earth, with a heavy liquid core. Then picture the crust, fractured and thin, slowly moving plates grinding together to cause earthquakes and volcanoes. Then visualize the water, not just the liquid, but also the frozen part. Think about all that water, and add this to it. Each gallon of water weighs 8 pounds. That is an awesome, unimaginable amount of water weight. And the place it has been stably positioned is moving to the oceans, taking the weight with it.
My thought is this, what happens when all that frozen water melts and redistributes around the globe? I would think the enormous weight distribution change would cause the plates which make up the earth's crust to shift, change speed and/or direction. Result, more earthquakes, in more places. Also more volcanic activity, which adds more global warming to the mix. And it could get weirder. What if the earth's spin gets thrown off, like a tire which loses a balance weight? The axis could shift, or the wobble we already have could change. I thought it was just me, but others have noticed the sun seems to go further north in the summer than it did just 30 years ago.
The science may support my thinking, maybe not. But it makes sense. Those plates aren't solidly mounted. It would be like an egg shell, hard-boiled. Crack it all around and gently squeeze it with a couple of fingers. Then move your fingers and squeeze again. The "plates" of shell will react differently, change direction. We could all be in for a rough ride. Since there's nothing we can do about it, don't worry. They worry about rising oceans. Hah! Worry more about the earth moving under your feet and the sky clogging with volcanic ash!
