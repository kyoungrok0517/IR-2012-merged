I am currently pre-Rad. I would like a good job in the imaging field. I was recently advised by a doctor that ultrasound is the way of the future & better money. Of course, it would pose less health risks. 

I would love to hear from people in that side of health sci to advise me as to a better specialty. I also considered finishing basic Rad and continuing to MRI, CT, etc. Please share your knowledge with me! 

If this helps, I am currently in the Triangle, NC, and hope to eventually work in Maryland/N.Virginia area.
