The town I'm in now seems to have mixed opinions (Iowa City, Iowa, US) - http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=iowa+city
It's really not that exciting.  I'm only there for university and as far as college towns in the US go, I guess it's not horrible, but I'm not staying here after I graduate.  Way too small of a town for me since the population is only like 60,000 or so (which differs from what urban dictionary says, but the person on there might have included suburbs).  
The most accurate assessment is in the fifth entry - "Snobby artsy emo types, spoiled Chicagoans and douchey jocks with beer bellies welcome."  Very true.

At least my hometown (Des Moines, IA) is a little better, but not much as evidenced by urbandictionary  - http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=des+moines  It's trashier, but there's more to do at least.  Still boring overall though.  Although this person got the side of town I'm from right - "East Side: Lower class to government subsidized housing, many drug users and meth labs, "East Siders" tend to try to act tough, mostly because they didn't have parents to raise them correctly. Most tend to perform poorly in high school and end up not going to college where they cycle continues over again, drive up liquor stores are common as well as tobacco outlets"
It doesn't fit me obviously since I'm in college, but a good portion of my high school class fits this description.
