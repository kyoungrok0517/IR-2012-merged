IT IS A MUST. If Sri Lanka hosts the IIFA function, that would be great disrespect to Tamils all over the world. The terrorist regime of Mahinda Rajapakse, aka the Sri Lankan government has done many atrocities to the Tamils over island with many Human Rights Violations and Genocide. If the IIFA is hosted there it is like a slap in the face for the Tamil cause and the Tamil people. Sri Lanka has killed over 100,000 Tamils all together during the war. They still have yet to give the Tamils their rights and full freedom. I hope Amitabh discards this visit and the IIFA in Sri Lanka.
