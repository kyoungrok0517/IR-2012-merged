Your question is missing a lot of information.
An FHA loan is for the purchase of a home.  

If you don't live there but plan to keep the home (you can't rent an FHA loan), you would need to continue paying the loan.  Otherwise, you would need to sell the home and pay off the loan.  If that is not done the lender will foreclose on you.
