1500, 2500 and 3500 designate the size of the truck

The smallest is a 1/4 ton, the 2500 is 1/2 ton and the biggeest truck is a 3/4 tone load capacity. Stand next to the trucks side by side and the difference is obvious.  They will also have different engine sized based ont he size of the truck.

The LT and LTZ are nothing more than trim packages.

Read the Chevy website if you want to know the differences.
