You do not get it all back at the same time.  You get a certain amount each month.  Typically, for each dollar that you earn, you pay $0.0765 (total of FICA and medicare) and receive $0.01 per year (so it takes 7.65 years to make back what you paid in).  For example, if you make $10,000 per year for 30 years, for a total of $300,000, then you pay in $765 per year and receive $3,000 per year when you retire.  I have not included inflation adjustments (cost of living increases) in any of these figures.
