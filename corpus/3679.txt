You said " Why do I feel despair when others are living the dream?"

  Well have you ever thought that it might be what you are telling yourself about others living their dream?  When you think about living your dream what exactly comes bubbling up from your subconscious mind?

  I would be willing to wager it is not positive! Stop  the negative internal babble and see what happens.

  Hope that helps.
