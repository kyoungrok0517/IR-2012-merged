I am going bald very young, I try not to let it bother me but it really is making me insecure and depressed as I am not even 21 yet.

I have heard you can get a hair transplant, where a surgeon takes hair grafts from the back or sides of your head and sticks them to the crown.

What exactly is involved in the procedure? Do you literally have a perfect hairline and thick hair, permanently, once you've had the operation? How much, in the UK, does it cost?

Any info welcome, serious, relevant answers only please.
