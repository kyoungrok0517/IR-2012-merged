I see that Angelina makes a habit of dating married men? I know that sex is the core of a man wanting to produce children and dominate. But why is Jennifer Aniston constantly just dating? Does anyone know why she can't settle down and remarry? Do you think she is making the right decisions after her incident with her true love?
