Parkinsons is a HORRIBLE disease. I watched my grandfather suffer with if for many years. I'm sorry you are going through the same thing. They have not found a complete cure for the disease just meds that help keep tremors down etc. The best thing to do is keep him comfortable and be there for him when he needs you. Its going to get harder and harder but you just need to be strong and be there. If you need to talk please email me. Like I said my grandfather had it and I know this is a very hard time for you and the rest of your family. Best wishes. -Allie
