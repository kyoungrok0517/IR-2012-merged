Hi,

Mutual funds was affected by the  current crisis, basically mutual funds invest in shares. 

Recent crisis affected almost in most area but I realize that only 1 market didn't really get affected which is foreign exchange market. I'm not saying on spotting the  market but rather buy or sell an options. Traded long term for good return which is low in risk margin.
