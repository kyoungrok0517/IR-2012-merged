My car is a toyota camry. I am not sure of the year 90 something. The clock went out a couple months ago and i bought a gps and tried to charge it but the cigarette lighter isn't working either. Ive read online that it is probably a fuse but  I have no idea what im doing? can i take it somewhere that isn't going to cost and arm and a leg to get it fixed? Or could someone explain how to do it myself? Please help.
