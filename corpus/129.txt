1. When the sun (with its spacious light) is folded up; 
2. When the stars fall, losing their lustre; 
3. When the mountains vanish (like a mirage); 
4. When the she-camels, ten months with young, are left untended; 
5. When the wild beasts are herded together (in the human habitations); 
6. When the oceans boil over with a swell; 
7. When the souls are sorted out, (being joined, like with like); 
8. When the female (infant), buried alive, is questioned - 
9. For what crime she was killed; 
10. When the scrolls are laid open; 
11. When the world on High is unveiled; 
12. When the Blazing Fire is kindled to fierce heat; 
13. And when the Garden is brought near;- 
14. (Then) shall each soul know what it has put forward. 
15. So verily I call to witness the planets - that recede, 
16. Go straight, or hide; 
17. And the Night as it dissipates; 
18. And the Dawn as it breathes away the darkness;- 
19. Verily this is the word of a most honourable Messenger, 
20. Endued with Power, with rank before the Lord of the Throne,
