they limit your ability to show your individuality 
they are usually ugly
they are boring


they cost less than designer clothes
they cut down on gang violence due to colors 
you dont have to spend a lot of time thinking about what to wear
there is less inappropriate clothing wore 
there is less distractions in class due to talking about someones clothes
the poor kids do not get pick on for haveing less than fashionable clothes 

Sorry I liked uniforms
