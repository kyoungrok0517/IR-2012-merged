I've seen some hair transplants on youtube and on the net overall. And they seem to lack any addition information about its continuity. What happens next? Does it grow normally? Are we expected for it to fall out and never grow? Can you trim or shave it? If there is an actual person who had had the hair transplant procedure, will you kindly give any valid information about it. Thank you.
