I'm doing a music project on the piece Peer Gynt Suite No. 1 by Edvard Grieg and I need to know to large and/or detailed form (like sonata, sonata-allegro, etc.) and its pattern (like ABA, AABBCC, etc.)  Or any other information about this piece you can give me, that would be great!  Thank you!
This piece is also known as "Morning Mood", if that helps at all.
I'm actually looking for the information on just the "Morning Mood" piece.  How many movements or parts are in this particular piece?
