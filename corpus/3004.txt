Hi!

The thing that worked for me was steady and consistent use of pure vitamin E oil. I applied it 2-3 times daily. The key is to make sure that it is vitamin E oil that is pure enough to be taken orally. I got mine from  health food store (and paid $18 for a small bottle). You can even purchase capsules and break them, although that tends to be messy.
It should, at the very least, make it less noticeable.
Hope this helps!
