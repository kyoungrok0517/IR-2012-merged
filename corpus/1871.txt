You can get a DNA test test done from the AKC for $40, but it will not prove the dog's breed.    There is no such DNA test available to prove breed.  DNA testing will only prove parentage from dogs who already have DNA profiles.

The DNA Profile Program is a voluntary program the fancy can use to strengthen their breeding programs. Participants receive an AKC DNA Profile with the dog's registration information, owner's name, DNA Profile Number, and the dog's actual genotype. 

In others words, if the parents do not have DNA profiles on file, you're out of luck.
