I am sorry people, but I feel very little sympathy for this woman. In my book she wilfully neglected her children just to have a "jolly" with her friends.
If it had happened to any other class of parents, they would have been crucified by every one.
After all there were three children, very young children, left unsupervised and there is my problem on this matter. WHY.
