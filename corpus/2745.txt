I love frogs also. I think they are very helpful in keeping insects down in your yard. You may have to go somewhere and catch some frogs and bring them to your yard if you don't have a pond.I don't have a pond and have never brought frogs to my yard, they just seem to show up when I added  a lot of green plants outside my house. I have lots of big leafy plants , especially on my front porch and on my  carport in back. Tree frogs reside in the front and toad frogs reside in back. I keep the plants well watered and the frogs love it. When I am watering the plants the frogs start "singing" (my husband thinks I'm nuts, he hates frogs).  I live in a rural area, there's lots of grass and trees around, but no lake or pond for miles. I love when it rains and the frog sounds are at their loudest. You don't have to have a pond for the frogs to hang around, but I'm sure they'd love one with lily pads in it. Just have lots of big green leafy plants for them to live in. The tree frogs will perch on your windows at night to catch bugs that are attracted to the light coming from inside your house. It's really fascinating to watch how fast they eat their prey.Be careful if you have cats, they love to play with the frogs, but sadly they end up playing to rough and kill them.
