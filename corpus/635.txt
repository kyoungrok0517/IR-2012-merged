I hunt a lot. I also watch a lot of hunting shows. A lot of times, they show the deer they shot the night before (the following morning) and the deer does not appear to be stiff. How do they do that? They can move the neck freely as if the deer never stiffened at all.

There must be some sort of trick to this I don't know about.
