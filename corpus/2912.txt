Christchurch
The largest city in the South Island of New Zealand, once used rather frequently by housewives and grandmothers as a mild expletive being roughly equivalent to gosh or darn.

While definitely not averse to using such words as fuck and cunt, modern New Zealanders take great delight in reliving the stultifying drudgery of the 1950s and will often be heard to utter (at least ironically) the phrase "Oh, Christchurch!", especially when tripping up, falling over, climaxing, etc.

Sarah: I enjoy wanking you.
Mike: Oh, Christchurch! You've snapped my banjostring! 

lol wtf.
