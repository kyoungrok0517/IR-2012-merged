Skateboarding was born in California and the first skaters were trying to mimicking surfing. They called skateboarding sidewalk surfing. It was something they did while the waves weren't that good. At this time the only skating was mainly freestyle skating. In 1972  Frank Nasworthy invents urethane skateboard wheels and theses wheels s spark new interest in skateboarding. When the ZBoys went to the Del Mar contest at showed the world their skating mimicked surfing it took the world by storm. The ZBoys were skating empty pools and that gave birth to pool skating and vert skating. In 1978 Alan Gelfand invents the Ollie and this change skateboarding forever as this gave birth to street skating. In 1988 skateboarding dies out and especially vert skating(which at this time dies out) the only skating be done is street skating. Espn in 1995 holds the first X Games and interest in vert skating is resurrected. Tony hawk releases first game in 1999 and it becomes my favorite game of all time. Go skateboarding day is held every June 21 starting in 2004. There you go
