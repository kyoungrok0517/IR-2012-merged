The charge off won't be any better or worse for your friend's credit rating that a foreclosure would be.  Both indicate a serious lack of handling debt.

If they 'charge it off', it doesn't get it out of her name.  She ends up on the title, along with any other liens and problems which may exist on the house.  Does she have a lot of unpaid back property taxes ?  Is this house falling down  ?  It's apparent that the bank does not WANT the house, for whatever reason it chose.  My guess is they think the foreclosure will cost them more than the house is worth.
