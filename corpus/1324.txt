good luck on that, its already expensive enough where i live, in South Laguna Beach, luckily my parents bought our house when prices were reasonable, now, itd prolly be around a few million or so because almost every house in laguna has an ocean coast view,

 and Newport Beach is said to have even more expensive housing, well depending on where around there you wanna live, generally Balboa Island and Newport Coast are said to have the most expensive houses around Newport Beach.

and itd definetely be possible to live in Newport Beach as a psychiatrist, you may not have one of the most fanciest/hugest houses, but still a nice enough home.
