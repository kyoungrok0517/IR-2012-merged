If by world you mean our planet, then, it will never end. The Scriptures say in Isaiah 45:18 

"For this is what Jehovah has said, the Creator of the heavens, He the [true] God, the Former of the earth and the Maker of it, He the One who firmly established it, who did not create it simply for nothing, who formed it even to be inhabited: â€œI am Jehovah, and there is no one else."

The earth was created for a purpose for humans to live on it forever. 

God still has this purpose in mind. We read in Ps 37:29:

"The righteous themselves will possess the earth, And they will reside forever upon it."

What will end, however, is wicked individuals that do not adhere to God's standards that he sets in is word for us. Ps 37:10 says: "....and the wicked one will be no more"

So God is giving us the opportunity now to listen to him through his word so that our lives can conform to what he requires of us and enjoy what he has in store for us, namely live forever on his restored paradise.
