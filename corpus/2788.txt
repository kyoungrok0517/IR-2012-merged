Eyam is a small village in Derbyshire, England, and is a delightful place to vist for a day out, having quite a number of visitor attractions locally. It is famous for its "well-dressing" celebrations (which have nothing to do with clothes but are to do with holes in the ground), which commemorate the ending of the plague and is held on the Suturday before the last Sunday in August.
