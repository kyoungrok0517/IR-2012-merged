If I were in a burning wreck of a plane - or a sinking ship - I would like to think (however idealistically it may seem) that children - and therefore their mothers - should have first dibs on safety and I would help them.

Who knows what the reality is when confronted with that?

A woman was interviewed on the BBC about being the survivor of a plane crash in Manchester, UK. The plane burst into flames taxiing and she scrambled over several people to get out because people behind her were being burnt to death and she suffered terrible guilt because she admitted knocking other people (weaker people) to one side to escape the flames.

Who wouldn't?  Politeness and protocol vanishes when you are being scalded by fire.
