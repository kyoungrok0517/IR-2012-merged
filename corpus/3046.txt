Time does help you stop feeling as hurt when something emotionally hurt  you before and if anyone else was involved they probably wont bring it up anymore but, as with almost all wounds that heal up, they leave behind a scar. In the case of emotions, this scar can be either 1) the fact you can remember it happened  or 2) something more drastic like those painful feelings resurfacing. 

Of course, sitting and sulking over the "wounds" will only make them fester and get infected, so it is better to just let them be, move on, and let them heal on their own to keep from it forming a larger and more visible scar.  

To sum it up. Life happens and you get hurt. You just need to let the hard times pass and move on. Though you will always remember the bad times, they will seem more like a piece in your life rather than something trying to tear it apart.

Hope this helped
