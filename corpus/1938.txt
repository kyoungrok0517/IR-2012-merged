The first Vikings to settle in the Shetlands, Orkney and Caithness may have been poor peasants seeking land from 780 AD onwards. This was one of the warmer periods and it seems that it was hot enough to grow wheat in Sutherland, (today oats and barley are  better crops). Later there were pirate attacks by more powerful chiefs and finally settlement. Sigurd the Mighty of Orkney extended his power into Moray. The Norwegian Jarl Pinar established a dynasty which lasted to 1231, when it became married into the Earldom of Angus. The Orkney Earls ruled over Shetland, Caithness and Sutherland, and under Thorfinn the Mighty united all the Viking holdings including the Hebrides, which he held in theory from the King of Norway. His daughter Ingibiorg married Malcolm Canmore.
Kenneth McAlpin King of Dalriada took advantage of a major victory of the Norse over the Picts in 841, to turn on his supposed allies and secure the dominance of the Scots over the two kingdoms. This is the beginning of Scotland.
There were many battles and skirmishes between Norsemen and Picts and Scots, and among one another. The famous legend which explains the adoption of the thistle as the Scottish emblem is only one of these, but is associated with the Battle of Largs not the North East of Scotland.
It was not until the defeat of  Hakon, King of Norway at the Battle of Largs that the Hebrides and the Isle of Man were ceded to the Scottish Kings by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. Orkney and Shetland did not become part of Scotland until they were part of the dowry of the Maid of Norway in 1468. Although the unfortunate girl died in a storm on the way to Scotland the wedding by proxy was good enough for the Scots to hold on to the islands.
