Why would the Japanese immigrate to the US when Japan by all means is a better country? sorry to break it to you but thats the stone cold truth, in fact if you go to places where there were once a significant Japanese population will find them all to be deserted.
A few years ago there were 43 Japantowns all across the US today there is only 3 left. 
Sure Japan is damaged right now because of the quake but they will rebuild, just like they always have.
