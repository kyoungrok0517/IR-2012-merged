There are a few reasons why it could be. 

1) It could be because the process isn't worth the costs involved. Foreclosure costs a lot of money on the side of the financial company: There are lawyer fees that can't be avoided, the property has to be appraised, the closing costs all need to be paid in order for the company to take control of the property. And then usually there are years of taxes owed to the county, and those have to be paid before the property can sell to anyone. It cost my company almost $12k to get a house from someone once, and we ended up having to write off over $60k more just to sell it to someone else. They may not be ready (financialy) to take the loss, and are waiting for a certain year or quarter to pass before they write it off.

2) Once we had some clients give their small piece of land up to us in a bankruptcy proceeding. It turned out that the land  was worth about as much as the taxes owed to the county, so we left it for the county to take. Which they did 3 years later, and we wrote off a small loss and saved ourselves a lot of hassle.

3) They may not have anyone working in the office who knows how to handle a foreclosure. It's a time consuming process that takes a certain level of experience or the legal implications can be huge.
