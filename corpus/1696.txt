You should go see a dentist qualified in TMJ pain.  
(By the way, you probably have TMD, temporamandibular disorder.  TMJ is a joint, temporomandibular joint.  Saying "I have TMJ" is like saying "I have elbow")
A qualified dentist can make a splint or bite guard.  It may retrain the muscles so that you no longer have myofascial pain.
