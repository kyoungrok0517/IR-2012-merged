I'm planning to make tarte tartin but don't want to buy another frying pan that's ovenproof. I have a non-stick frying pan with a non-metal handle that I'm pretty sure is not ovenproof. There's a small screw that secures the handle to the pan, so is it safe to use the pan in an oven if I remove the handle? Thanks in advance!
