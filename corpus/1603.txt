No, all their songs suck! Those two are their best songs. All their other songs suck even worse than those two! It is all downhill from those two songs. 
I guess "All Apologies" is alright. It is more mellow & laid back & Kurt doesn't screech & scream as much as usual. But it's still a very bad song.

Don't waste your time on them. It is nice to see someone else thinks they are crap cause they are!

Try Alice In Chains, they rock and are much better and they blow Nirvana out of the water.
