Pheromones are a con. Humans lost the ability to sense pheromones many generations ago even though other animals use them. We do not need them nor do we find them attractive (they don't do anything for us). Pheromones that are used in perfumes etc are not human pheromones but usually pig pheromones. Don't plan any visits to piggeries if you use them.

Why would anyone buy anything endorsed by Paris Hilton?
