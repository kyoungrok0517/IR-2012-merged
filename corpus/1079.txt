I'm filling out a traffic accident report for the California DMV. There's one field that asks for "Vehicle Owner - Person or Company". I leased my car from Honda. I also have a cosigner - he's a relative who doesn't live here, and I'm the only driver. What do I write down in this field? I need to know this ASAP please.
Thanks
