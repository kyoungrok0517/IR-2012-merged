first off, the number of dead lowered the number of possible hosts for the disease, plus people slowly figured out what was going on and with proper quarantines, it died off. and actually its cool cause the drop in population strengthened the economy by lowering the number of poor people and by killing the rich, there was more money to go around. we probably need another to come through but oh well.
