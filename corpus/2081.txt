i bought it from a used car lot I didn't know it had a REBUILT SALVAGED TITLE i looked it up under dodge website it had recalls  dodge told me they won't fix them do to the fact of the title they also told me not to Drive it the recalls are the brakes will stop working at any time without warning and another can start a under body fire i talked to a lawyer before about the title but not this
i know i should have did a car fax before i bought it
i am from michigan
