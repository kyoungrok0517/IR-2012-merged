My daughter has an appointment coming up to see her pediatrician. She is seven years old and has history of hair loss and anemia.  Her iron levels recently have dropped half to only 9% saturation...and now her teeth are turning grey. She has just started iron supplements again after three months of not taking them, so i don't believe the iron is the source of the grey teeth. She is going to get more blood tests, but I am anxious to fnd out what might be the cause of the above symptoms.
