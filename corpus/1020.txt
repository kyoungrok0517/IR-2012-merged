I've been on Royal Caribbean and Disney, and between those two I'd say Royal Caribbean is best. From what I've heard, Princess tends to have more elderly people and Carnival is the crazy party ship.

Royal Caribbean has a rock climbing wall, basketball court, a pool or two on the main deck, a private adult pool, hot tubs, various bars, stage shows every night, ice skating rink, fitness machines, running track, teen club, adult night club, game room (bunch of board games and such), and then some

I liked all of the above ^ and at the teen club I met so many new friends! It was great because it was a Mediterranean cruise and there were a bunch of kids from all over the world! You never go hungry on those cruises, especially because there's a 24/7 snack bar whenever you get a snack attack! There are parades and even an all cruise midnight buffet one night. You seriously cannot get bored on Royal Caribbean because there's something for everyone..sounds cliche but it's true!

You'll have so much fun! :)
