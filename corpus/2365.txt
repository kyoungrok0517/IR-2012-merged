1. Earthquakes are a good indication that the underlying rocks are heaving fractured or faulted.

2. WIth advances in technology scientists can quite accurately predict whether earthquakes can occur. they do so by measing seismic activity, gas emissions, changes in the earth`s surface, etc, and this gives good, reliable earthquake predictions.

3.The earthquakes in that are are probably low on the Richter scale, that is they are very small. The plate movement in that area is most likely divergent as these type of plate margins produce the most gentle earthquakes, thus the earthquakes in that area are not violent and do not cause much damage.


Hope this helps :)
