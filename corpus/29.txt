From what I've heard about hybrid cats, they often do best with a raw diet. These websites should get you started.

If you want to feed canned (dry is NOT a good choice at all), go with the lowest possible carbohydrate content and supplement with some raw food. Here's a chart showing the carbohydrate contents of many foods. I would verify the information with the manufacturer (ask for the carbohydrate content on an as-fed basis). Grain-free is great, but sometimes manufacturers replace the grains with other carbohydrates with potatoes or sweet potatoes, which aren't much better. So just go with the foods with the highest protein and the lowest carbohydrate content. This often requires limiting yourself to certain flavors within the same brand.

Good luck!
