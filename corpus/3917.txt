I would press on with going to see the fertility specialist.  I assume this is an RE you're talking about.  An RE will not only assess your fertilty health, but will address your estrogen dominance problem.  He/she is going to want to do some testing anyway, so there's no harm in making your appointment while you're finishing up a cycle.

As for the Provera... it is a form of progesterone and as long as you are taking it, you will not ovulate nor will you conceive.  Your chances for your current cycle are non-existent.

Good luck, I hope you find a good RE to help you.
