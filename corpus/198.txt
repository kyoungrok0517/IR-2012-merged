There are many theories, and most of them are bogus. The things that actually could kill the planet are scarier than the things they make up.

I have heard that there is a hidden planet that we can't detect that is supposed to hit the earth in 2012. That's a fake one.

Or there's the galactic alignment that's supposed to flip our magnetic field upside down. The magnetic field has reversed polarity in the past (long before humans), but it's very rare and a "galactic alignment" won't do it.

There are giant comets and asteroids that could hit us. Those are real, but they are very unlikely.

My personal favorite is the gamma ray burst. You don't hear about them much unless you're interested in astronomy. Basically, they are like a laser where the beam is far bigger than the size of the earth. They are so powerful that we can see them from 13 billion light years away. That means it's so far it took the light 13 billion years to get here. They only last about 2 seconds to 2 minutes each, but in that time frame, they pump out as much energy as our sun will in its entire life time (several billions of years).

If one of those things is within 10,000 light years of us, it would completely annihilate the planet! And the best part is, there's actually a star about 8000 light years away that could possibly make one!
