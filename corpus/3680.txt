I have post partum depression/anxiety.  I bought two books looking for an author with a common experience so I do not feel so alone in this.  (I have very few friends.  And absolutely zero that are suffering from depression, which makes me feel like an even odder odd ball)  The two books that I have read are by authors that have trouble bonding with their baby for some reason or another.  We had no trouble bonding, me and my baby and I'm completely in love with him. Furthermore,  I think that I'm doing a pretty okay job at being a first time mom, but I'm still depressed all the time.  Can anyone make a suggestion on a book about post partum depression/anxiety by an author who is not having trouble bonding with their new baby?  (I have been on Amazon and cannot find anything.)
I forgot to mention, my little guy is 10 months old.  I'm seeing a therapist about the depression/anxiety.  And "me time" is like a punishment to me.  (My husband said that he'd watch the baby yesterday while I took a nap.  I laid in bed for 45 minutes, heard my little guy playing, and had to go out to see what he was doing, I didn't want to miss any time with him.)
