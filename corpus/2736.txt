Build a pond.  fill it with water. plant some marsh plants aournd it. make a big ol logpile and heap up some stones. Leave it.  Come next april. Go get some frogspawn.  If your short of that whereveer you are come on down to Gnoll Park, Neath, there will be TONNES of the stuff lying around.  Half the time you cant even walk around there without stepping on a frog.
