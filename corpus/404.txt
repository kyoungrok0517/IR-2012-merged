I once read a story about how Moses gave the go ahead to his people to poison the first born in Egypt as a part of a plan, so that they could emancipate themselves from the Egyptians. But what kind of poison did they use? And how did they administer this poison to the first born in Egypt? 

I read this story in a book titled, "Word Controlled Humans," by John Harland.
