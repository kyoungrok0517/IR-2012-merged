We're looking into the costs of renovating out roof. We're trying to price out what it would cost to do it on our own vs. hiring someone to do it. We have friends/family that do roofing but I want to make sure I cover all our basis because they may forget to mention something we need.

I contacted the city about what sort of permit(s) would be required already so we'll have to see what comes from that.

Basically we have to rip it off all the way to the rafters. It's got shingles, wooden shingles and the old sheeting needs to be replaced as well. While we have it open we'd like to insulate if financially feasible at the time.

We know that we would need:
Sheeting, Shingles a vapor barrier (possibly insulation)
We discussed some safety equipment like the masks seen on dr. shows because the old wooden shingles are past their prime to say the least.
We also imagine needing scaffolding and possibly some harnesses. (the roof is about a 35 degree angle.)
Also we'd need a few nail guns, hammers, nails.

Can you confirm any of these and list other things we're missing?
Is there a site with Canadian building codes that you know of to make sure we meet those as well?
We wouldn't attempt it without that....we have friends and family that are in the roofing business. I mentioned that already.
