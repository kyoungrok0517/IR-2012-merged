This is bullshit. I save up all my bottles and cans because we have to recycle now which is good but when I get to any grocery story they only take half the bottles and cans I have because they say they don't sell the brands I have. Not to mention how the machines are always full and are the biggest pieces of shit to use. Is there a place that just takes everything and gives you the five cents?
