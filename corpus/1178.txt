As a hitter/position player, 1921. (There are other choices. This is like picking the best bloom off a champion rosebush. Hard to go wrong.) His second-best adjusted OPS, but played more games than his best (1920), and that represents real value.

As a pitcher, 1916. Ace-quality stuff all season long. Had there been a Cy Young Award (or equivalent), he may very well have won it.
