Most of what the first respondent wrote is ok.  However, keep in mind not all orchids are tropical or epiphytes.  The lady slipper orchids grow in water logged soils that can be quite acidic and more moderate temperatures.  Epiphytes need a medium for their roots that dries out after being watered on a daily basis.  So if your are trying to grow your own orchids, you need to determine the specific growing conditions for the orchids you want to grow.  A good book on orchids would be a good starting point.
