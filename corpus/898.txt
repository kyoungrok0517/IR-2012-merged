"Hispanic" can refer to a *lot* of people and countries (including those in South America, Mexico, Spain, etc):
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic
...so it's hard to give a narrow answer to your question since the cuisines of those countries and peoples vary a huge amount.

Also don't know what you mean by "authentic"... just not Mexican foods the way they're served at Taco Bell or something?  Or do you mean only recipes that are still made or were originally made in those countries (although they may have been changed since then by people still living there, or by those having moved away).

At any rate, here are loads of recipes for Mexican foods in particular:

For all the other countries you might include in "Hispanic," just substitute the name of a country or people for the word Mexican or Mexico in those same searches (in your browser bar).
