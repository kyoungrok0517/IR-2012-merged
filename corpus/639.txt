you need to force the neck to move at first, so it breaks the rigor mortis, once the rigor is broken, it'll move freely from then on, also if left for more then 8 hours, it'll naturally lose it's rigor.
rigor mortis is the stiffening of the muscles after death.
easy to do usually, just keep moving the head and it'll start to loosen up, it'll eventually be as lose as if just shot.

Edit**
when moving the head/neck, your actually tearing small muscle fibers in the process, so your only left with flexible ones instead of mostly stiff ones.
