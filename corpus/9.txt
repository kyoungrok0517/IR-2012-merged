I dont know who to tell you is bad, but I can tell you who is good. call breeders and ask them if they show their cats. Most of the time, a breeder that uses their cats in shows will have high quality breeding. Beware of new breeders!!! Call breeders and ask these questions:

Do you activly show cats in cat shows?:
If so, which ones?:
How long have you been breeding?:
What kind of food do you feed?:
Do you have a health guarantee?:

And a few others that I'm sure you can come up with.

Good luck!
