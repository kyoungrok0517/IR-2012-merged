Notice the phrases like, "And it came to pass," "And the Lord spake unto Moses," and "And the Lord said unto Moses."

Each of these makes it look like there is a continuation, but it's a literary device used so the speaker doesn't have to cede to another until he's done (or, more likely, it signals to the reader/listener that the topic has not changed).  It's like a run-on sentence on steroids.

 However, they really are breaks in the narrative.  The Lord revealed his instructions to Moses piecewise, giving him time to write them down and take care of other important things in between.  He probably also helped Moses remember what he'd said, unless getting a talking-to from the Lord is an unforgettable experience.
