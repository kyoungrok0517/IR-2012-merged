Just to add a bit to what SweetFlower said, a third wave would also not have the element of surprise anymore.  Later that night, some american planes coming into land at Hawaii got shot to pieces by the ground forces around pearl harbor.  Tragic, but it showed the defenders were now up and ready.  Also, the unknown location of the american carriers.  The japs were afraid they might show up and counter attack while their planes were out on another strike or rearming.  That's how the japs lost at midway.
