what is The aim of this movie? Israel and Egypt become friends and as nothing is happening ? I would better watch another movie where Egyptian military men are treated with respect and owner , if they are doing this same story but inside of Egypt without Israel then it is something normal but what is not normal is a military men going to Israel for the first time to be treated like dogs NO!!!

We don''t have any problem with Jewish people but we have a problem with Israeli people...there is a big difference...

Jewish people are religious men but Israeli people are stealing lands and killing children so going there is a no no no

after peace and the having all rights of Palestinian people we would see what kind of a movie we will make...
