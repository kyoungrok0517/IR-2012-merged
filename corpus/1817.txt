The main thing you want to consider is the quality of the wood used, and how long the shaft has been treated.  Most low quality cues rush the shafts and cues out and they end up warping.  No sense in spending $80 on a cue when its going to be junk in a month, when you could spend $70 or so more and the cue will last you a life time.  You want to look at it like a 1 investment.  If you look into the lower end Vikings or McDermotts you will be able to find something you like a low price with a life warranty on defects.  Stay way from cues made in china.  I do use a players hustler to break with, but guess what happened... The shaft is warped a bit.  Not enough to effect my break, but if I was shooting with it would be different story.  As for joints, weight, you'll have to find what feels right for you.  Everyone is different.  1 thing though... Don't ever put a soft tip on your cue unless you plan on taping every shot.  1 stern shot and you tip will have a flat spot. Good luck, and keep rackin em up!
