Alesha had an excellent answer that Nagumo was afraid that the US carriers would be out looking for him while he was busy with the 3rd wave attack on Pearl.  He was also due to take these same ships, planes and pilots into the southern attack as soon as he got back from Hawaii.

I disagree with her about Nagumo's experience, no admirals had vast experience in naval air warfare as it was a relatively new part of the service and had yet to be fully tried in actual combat.

A third attack, even if successful, would not have resulted in a US pullback from Hawaii, the public would never have allowed the US to abandon Hawaii unless forced to do so.  The only thing that would have happened with a third wave would be that the sunken hulks in Pearl Harbor would not have floated and pushed into dry docks for repairs.  The US would have used that energy in rebuilding and refitting the battleships into building brand new ones.

The Japanese could not have landed a land assault, they didn't bring any land troops with them to do it with.
