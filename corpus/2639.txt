I honestly believe that when it comes out on November 21st i think that Twilight will beat Titanic. The books made the top seller list so why wouldn't the movie? All girls will go to see how incredibly well Rob Pattinson plays the incredibly Hot Edward Cullen and all the guys should go to take notes on how to be Edward Cullen to get the girls. So why wouldn't it beat Titanic!?!?!
