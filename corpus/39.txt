If you have a Bengal, you will need to be very familiar with a cat comb. My little guy gets the worst hairballs if he isn't brushed daily during shedding season and weekly the rest of the year. Even with all the brushing, he still gets a couple hairballs during the shedding season. I seriously get handfuls of hair out of him. It is a never ending supply. A cat comb is the only product I have found that can really get down into the hair and pull out of the loose fur. The coat is just so dense. I seriously considered getting him a lion cut this past year, but he would not behave for the groomer.

It helps to use swift movements to build up static electricity so that the fine hairs will gather in the comb.

My Bengal gets more hairballs than my domestic short hair.
