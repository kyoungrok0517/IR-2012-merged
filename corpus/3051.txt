Time does Not Heal all wounds...
The scar is always there even when one heals.

Forgiveness is for yourself not the person you are forgiving
and to truly Heal one must forgive...

I have seen what Hate and unforgiving feelings can do to people over the decades...it is like poison eating at them slowly with no effect on the person they choose Not to Forgive and sadly it effects their health, well being and mental state...
