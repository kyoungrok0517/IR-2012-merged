I will be going in December, to the Southern Caribbean as a single traveler. Have you been there and what suggestions can you offer, as I'll be stopping in St Maaten, St Lucia, St Thomas, Barbados, and St Johns. I'm into beaching, and wonder if you know of a great beach in those islands that I should not miss.

Thank you.
