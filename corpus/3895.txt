I'm looking to start radiology technologist school next fall. I'm 25, and my husband is 27. We've been married for five years, and aren't in any immediate rush to have children. Still, we've talked about starting to try in the next few years. I know radiography school takes two years (at least the accredited programs in my state take two years) and I'm just curious to find out what limitations I would have should I become pregnant during the program. I'm not worried about getting homework done, or anything like that, I'd time it so I'd be due during a break from the program if possible. I'm more worried about not being allowed to do certain coursework because of the radiation risk to the baby.

Also, for those of you in the field, when you did choose to have children did it limit what you could do in your jobs? I would go straight from school, to work, and we don't want to wait much longer than two years. (I have issues with endometriosis, so we're hesitant to even wait right now since we've been told there is a chance we'll need to pursue IUI or IVF). Still, I would hate to spend two years working on my degree, only to find out I can't work if I do get pregnant. (In that case, I feel like it would be better to get pregnant and have a child during a school break, and then when I got into my career I wouldn't have to worry about pregnancy limiting me.)

The program is for radiography technologist, so basic X-ray. I'd like to move into CT eventually, but the end goal is to certify as a nuclear medicine technologist.
