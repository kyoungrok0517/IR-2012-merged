When a hurt is so deep as being one of the 'first love' variety and to a 'love at first sight' type person , with a betrayal type hurt, I don't know because it seems as though wound and scar get kinda blurred together and it seems as though the scar tissue, if you will, hurts or causes a hurt and a sting as sharp and deep as any hurt one can have. Time if anything seems to only cause the ache to be more pronounced and as though everything reminds of that person and while it brings back some of the sweetness from that love, it brings back the reality that it is gone forever too. So, therefore I'm not so sure I'm a believer that time heals all wounds...I hope you are...best to you...
