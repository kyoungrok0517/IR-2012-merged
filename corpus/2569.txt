The captain etc knew well before the passengers because they tried to shut off the bottom of the ship were it was flooding. Therefore the crew members who were working in the bowels of the ship would have known when the water poured in. 
Everyone on board would have realised the ship scraped the iceberg. AKA film those on board saw the iceberg too close to the ship if they were on deck. I think the first time anyone though "oh ****" would have been when the ship began to list.
That is my opinion. There is plenty of information on the net about the titanic.
 Remember though the majority thought it was unsinkable so even when they were in the lifeboats some would have thought it was a load of old nonsense.
