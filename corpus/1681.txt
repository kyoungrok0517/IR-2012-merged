Sometimes, I read books that mention brands, shows, movies, and other books that were/ are popular or familiar during a certain year or decade. What is the policy on mention this kind of thing in a work of fiction or where can I find legal information about mentioning one of the above things? Thanks. 

I'm not adding it just to throw it in, it actually ties into my story.
