Savings Bonds need to be claimed when they hit maturity. If you don't, they will contact the Saving Bonds' owner first. If after certain trials or time, he/she is still unable to be located, one of these will happen:

1. They put the money from to old Savings Bonds to the new Saving Bonds.

2. They take the money out, then place fund to the location agreed in the contract / prospectus (maybe to charity house, hospital, cancer research etc).

3. They keep the money until somebody comes to claim it. During this time, they will be using the money without giving you any benefits (dividend etc).


However, policy changes time to time. I suggest you to check with the appropiate person to make sure what I wrote above are correct.
