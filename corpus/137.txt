I think of overpopulation, overfishing,  lack of natural resources will cause our world to come to an end soon in our future ( 15 years or so). I think we will run out recourse's, people starve, no one has jobs, riots start breaking out and governments have to start killing mass numbers of civilians. Its not really the end of the world, but I think its an end to our way of life.
