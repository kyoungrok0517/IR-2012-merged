Julius Robert Oppenheimer (April 22, 1904 - Feb 18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist and professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley.

He is often called the father of the atomic bomb, along with Enrico Fermi, for his role in the Manhattan Project, the World War II project that developed the first nuclear weapons.

Oppenheimer remarked after the first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945 in the Trinity Test in New Mexico "Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."
