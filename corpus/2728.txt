I don't know how big a large critter tote is, but I'm going to say that it's probably not big enough. I keep my White's in a 20H with a screen top. They need something taller as opposed to longer. It'll need a warm side and a cooler side. They need places to hide and a water dish that is deep enough that they get down in it, but not so deep that it totally covers. They need a safe substrate. You'll need a thermometer and a hygrometer.  (They eat a lot of dirt while they hunt.) You don't need a timer for the light, but it makes life a lot easier. My tank has live plants, so that takes a little effort as well. As mentioned before, they need a variety of live foods. Mine eats crickets and occasionally a wax worm or meal worms. they also require a vitamin supplement powder. Keep in mind that your food source needs food too. I feed my crix veggie scraps, oatmeal, and alfalfa pellets.

White's tree frogs make great pets. They are ideal for beginners. They are nocturnal, so you will not see them do very much during the day. They are fun to watch at night, especially after feeding.

Another option that you might check out is the fire bellied toads. They are less expensive, require a lot less space, eat less, don't need a basking light or water heater, and are extremely active during the day.
 
Edit: I don't use a red light or emitter because it gets too hot. I use a 40W bulb in a dome lamp.
