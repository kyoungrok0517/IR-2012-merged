I fasted for about 37 days but I am an atheist.  I don't know why religionists call missing a couple of days fasting. It is highly energizing, after a couple of days you don't think about food anymore, excepting when you have to explain to someone why you can't join them for dinner,  and it is very healthy for most people.
