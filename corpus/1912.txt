They were both isolated from the continent by England, so didn't have continental enemies. In fact they have both been allies of France at different times. As others have said, they did cause trouble for each other at times.

Scotland was split between the English-speaking Lowlands and the lawless Gaelic Highlands, and Ireland didn't really have central government at all. There were lots of small chiefs who would make alliances with whoever was convenient.
