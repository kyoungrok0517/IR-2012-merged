It didn't work for me, but I think a part of you really needs to want to quit first.  I'd class it as an assistive tool rather than a cure tool.  To avoid a scam artist try to consult the membership directories of the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis http://www.asch.net
The Society of Clinical and Experiment Hypnosis http://www.sceh.us/ 
and the American Psychotherapy & Medical Hypnosis Association http://APMHA.com/ 

All three require health profession licensure as a basis for membership.
