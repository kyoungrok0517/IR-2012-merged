Fasting can be good if you are using it to refocus on God and what His will is for your life.   But, you can not bargain with God!   If you are fasting to get something out of it, you are doing it for selfish reasons.   Just pray and have condifence that whatever happens it is for good and God will continue to guide you.   

Our faith is not a rewards basis, like your friend is suggesting.  It is based on the fact that we can do nothing good in and of ourselves and that God graciously and mercifully saved us from our sin!
