my family and i (fam. of 4) just got back from a 4 night royal caribbean cruise to the bahamas. it was about $2000 (airfare not included), + about $500 spent on board. i didn't think it was a bad price for a vacation in today's economy. it was considered a short cruise by experienced cruisers, but i found it to be the perfect way to experience cruising for the first time.

oh and definitely go for RC over carnival. i heard the two are at completely different standards. personally, i loved RCCL and i don't think i'll ever go with another cruiseline.
