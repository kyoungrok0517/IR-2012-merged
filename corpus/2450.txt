actual telephones were property of the telephone company, and leased to consumers, similar to how cable companies lease there cable box to you today... I am still trying to find out when phones were first offered for sale in the stores, but that would have to be some time in the 1970's

(EDIT) ok.. seems that purchasing your own phone was a little later then I assumed..  that happened around 1984 when AT&T was broken up into the smaller bell companies... http://www.porticus.org/bell/bell_system_property.html
