Your opinion is not wrong.

I agree that children should go first, but not necessarily women.  If my "Masculine Man" let me off first (which I know he would because he cares for me), I would be grateful, but at the same time miserable knowing that he would not likely join me.  It is horrible to be the one left behind.
