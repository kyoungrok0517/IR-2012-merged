Question 1: "Emotional Alchemy" by Tara Bennett-Goleman. This book helped me through my own depression several years ago. Another book I have heard of, though I have not read is 'Becoming Your Own Therapist' by Lama Yeshe. I have ready many books by Lama  Yeshe and he is a great, helpful writer. You may be able to get it for free (there may be a shipping cost) on the Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive website

Question 2: http://viewonbuddhism.org/depression.html is a very great, and helpful website.
