Well, part of it was the fact that microsoft wanted to have a browser included with Windows that made it easy for its customers to get online as soon as they had windows installed. At the time, netscape charged for its browser and microsoft decided to just give it away for free, ultimately trying to weave it entirely into the fabric of Windows itself before antitrust stuff got in the way (i still find all the hubub over that rather silly, its microsoft's product and they can do what they want with it, they never prevented other browsers from being installed). In essence, microsoft was innovating from the standpoint of trying to have a good all in one OS/Web browser setup vs having to go get one after installing or without microsoft paying netscape or someone else to include a browser with windows.
