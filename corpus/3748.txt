Yes to all. Any unhealthful condition can cause stress, anxiety and depression just based on the quality of life and resulting situations (i.e. lack of exercise perhaps, limited dating life, etc.) OCD is a spin-off of anxiety in a way because it is sympotamtic of a need to control surrounding and situations to cope with the stress. 

Losing weight and exercising both go hand in hand with better self image and overall mental health.
