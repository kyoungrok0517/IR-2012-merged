Chapter 2 of the Qur'an - Al Baqarah (The Cow), is largely about the Children of Israeli 

002.051 And remember We appointed forty nights for Moses, and in his absence ye took the calf (for worship), and ye did grievous wrong.

002.052 Even then We did forgive you; there was a chance for you to be grateful.

002.053 And remember We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion (between right and wrong): There was a chance for you to be guided aright.

002.054 And remember Moses said to his people: "O my people! Ye have indeed wronged yourselves by your worship of the calf: So turn (in repentance) to your Maker, and slay yourselves (the wrong-doers); that will be better for you in the sight of your Maker." Then He turned towards you (in forgiveness): For He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.

002.055 And remember ye said: "O Moses! We shall never believe in thee until we see God manifestly," but ye were dazed with thunder and lighting even as ye looked on.

002.056 Then We raised you up after your death: Ye had the chance to be grateful. 


002.092 There came to you Moses with clear (Signs); yet ye worshipped the Calf (even) after that, and ye did behave wrongfully.

002.093 And remember We took your Covenant and We raised above you (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): "Hold firmly to what We have given you, and hearken (to the Law)": They said:"We hear, and we disobey:" And they had to drink into their hearts (of the taint) of the Calf because of their Faithlessness. Say: "Vile indeed are the behests of your Faith if ye have any faith!"

002.094 Say: "If the last Home, with God, be for you specially, and not for anyone else, then seek ye for death, if ye are sincere."

002.095 But they will never seek for death, on account of the (sins) which their hands have sent on before them. And God is well-acquainted with the wrong-doers .
