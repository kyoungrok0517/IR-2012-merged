What Gaspode said. I'm a member of AARP. No surveys. I have been researching on my own for five years. Wanted to move to AZ (lived there 16 years). Florida is out of the question-way to humid, bugs, "old people". AARP had advertising from Tennessee (who wants to live where yuo know no one).
I have decided to move to a seniors retirement community in Colorado Springs. Not because of weather, it's where my grand children are.
