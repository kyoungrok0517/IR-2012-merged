building a new home with an upstairs and simply cannot afford hardwood stairs! can i use softwood? like 2x12 for stringers and 2x10 cut to size for treads? its an open riser staircase with closed stringers. i already asked and found out open risers are permitted. But it will only have 2 stringers spaced 36 inches. treads set on angle iron brackets. sounds strong but is there regulations that say no to softwood? i live in Nova Scotia.
