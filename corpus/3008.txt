A couple of weeks ago I burned my right side of my cheek with my curling wand and I used a mexican plant called"savila" and I also used a lotion called vaselina and I stopped using it because it didn't help and I don't want to waste money on a surgery so what are some home remedies to at least lighten face scars? It's not that big but it's very dark and I hate it
