It would be a good idea to take away uniforms because it only adds up to the school expenses that parents have to worry about. 

However, if public schools do follow this rule from the president I think that they have to tighten their security for the safety of the kids. School admins should strictly implement the wearing of IDs and have fetchers and guardians provide proper identifications when picking up the kids.
