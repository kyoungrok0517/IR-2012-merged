The age for partial benefits is still 62 and for someone born in 1969 it is still 66-67 right now for full benefits but by the time you reach 62, the age for full benefits will be increased to 70 and partial benefits is planned to increase to 64. That is all I know about. You have a long way to go so why are you thinking about it?
