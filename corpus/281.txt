I am jewish and we have to fast everyone year. This holiday is called Yom Kippur, and its basically apologizing for all the wrong-doings you have done in the past year. Judaism uses lots of fasting in its religon. Example: If you drop the Torah you have to fast. In Ramadan, you can only eat when the sun is down. So, I guess that no, I don't not agree with your friend because people fast mostly as a punishment from G-d. People do not fast expecting G-d to answer their prayers.
