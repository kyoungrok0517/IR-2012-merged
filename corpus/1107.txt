I got into a car accident (car vs. tree) and the cop gave me a ticket for failure to stay in designated lane, I know I have to tell meps about the ticket but do I have to tell them about the accident, and can they see the traffic accident report?
ok, could i dumb down the accident and it was really nothing and i didnt go to the hospital or will they find that out to?
