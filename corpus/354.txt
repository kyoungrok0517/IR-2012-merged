Yes, either lender can initiate a foreclosure to recover what is due to them.  You would assume the first mortgage as well.  You would also be responsible for any unpaid property taxes as well.

If you are not experienced with buying foreclosed properties then don't do it... or at least work with someone who is.  Don't trust a bunch of 13 year olds on Yahoo Answers for real estate advice.
