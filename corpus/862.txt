The majority of Americans who love Mexican food know absolutely nothing about Mexican culture or Mexico at all, except for the run-of-the-mill stereotyped jargon you get from Hollywood and disinformed marketing yakkety yak.

What many Americans perceive as Mexican is not Mexican at all, but an Americanized version of dishes that are modified to suit American tastes.

Real Mexican fare uses fresh instead of frozen, canned or precooked ingredients. Meals are a time for families to bond together, have a good time and just enjoy. Our meals here are vastly different from the quickie sandwich lunches favored by Americans. Our cultures are different, Mexican cuisine is a melange of Prehispanic, Spanish and French cooking which makes it unique and very delicious.

I wish more people would actually enjoy real Mexican cuisine and broaden their knowledge of it instead of settling for aberrations like Taco Bell.
