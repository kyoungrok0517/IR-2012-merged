We are planning to attend an all day convention this summer with our son who will then be 4 1/2 months old. I am looking for an option for napping while there at our seats other than blanket on the floor.  Most moses basket descriptions state up to 10 weeks, but would a moses basket placed on the floor be a good option for napping safe and snug?  I hate to spend the $ only to find out there are better ideas out there?  The infant carrier really isn't an option bc there isn't enough room
