My friend is really scared of birds, but she doesn't know why. I've taken several psychology classes and she's asked me to help her. She was talking to me about maybe trying hypnosis, so I told her I'd look into it. I don't really know anything about hypnotism or how to hypnotize anyone. I'm looking for either websites that give quick how-to's FOR FREE or anyone that types up a way to do it. I'm also looking for explanations on how it works. Thank you so much to who ever answers!
