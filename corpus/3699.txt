Last year on the Missing Children's Website it quoted that there were 181 children currently missing in UK and 77,134 in Europe, this is not a misprint, 77,134.

Can anyone, without looking at the missing childrens website, actually name any of these children?
I bet you can't, and why, because the McCann bandwagon with all their well paid advisors and publicists just manipulate the media to their own advantage.
If anyone does not believe the above figures check them out on the missing childrens website for yourself.
