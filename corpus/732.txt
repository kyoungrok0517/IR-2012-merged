Dachshunds and beagles alike do terrible in cold weather. They are both short hair breeds, and are not equipped for cold weather. Dachshunds are especially susceptible to cold because of their low stature, and long body. You should never have a dog as an outside dog. My advise is to never leave your dog outside.
