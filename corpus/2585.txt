According to a documentary, it was because of human error. 
Two instances:

One: The "screws" holding the boat together were made out of weaker material than what was prescribed. If they were made with the prescribed material, the ship would've held together even after the crash. 

Two: The Titanic received numerous warnings about ice on the sea but they didn't want to listen. Kinda stupid, eh? lol 

But the main reason was really those "screws" (I forgot what they were called)
