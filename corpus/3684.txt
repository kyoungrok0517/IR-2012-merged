We read that Kate McCann admits that she suffered from depression and had suicidal thoughts after the Madeleine went missing in Portugal. I have the deepest heartfelt sympathy for her plight. But what confuses me is why Kate spent so much time consulting Lawyers, Authors, PR specialists and TV producers, rather than consulting a psychiatrist. Perhaps this seems a cynical approach but I think the question needs to be asked ?

PS I'm not sure that the Guardian who published the story of Kates depression should have attached to the article that particular photo, while it does get across Kates anguish, it makes Gerry look like he is smirking, that surely wasnt what he would have intended.
