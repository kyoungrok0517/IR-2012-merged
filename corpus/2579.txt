Apparently rogue icebergs are still a thing of danger.
The Titanic didnt have sophisticated sonar on board like most ships of today to detect the iceberg, just look outs. Because the ship wasnt very manourverable like todays ships and was at full steam at night, the posted lookouts didnt see the iceberg whose main mass was submerged under water, till the last minute.
What ultimately killed all those people was the freezing cold water and lack of life boats.
