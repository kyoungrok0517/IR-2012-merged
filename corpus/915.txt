I agree with the Sister who said that Art should have no borders. There is a difference between art not having any borders and being unsuitable to be seen. If it is passed by the censors then it is your option to fogo and see it or not. . I am not the biggest lover of Israel but it would not deter me from going to see a movie that had good social comment and artistic values. 
To the lady who mentioned the Satanic Verses by Rushdie. That's dredging real low girl! 
That was a novel and just because the old Ayatollah didn't think it fit to read then there is no reason that it should not be taken for its literary value. 
Islam's surely not that fragile that it could have been effected by a work of  what was recognised as fiction. This is the same sort of narrow intellect that reacted to the more recent Dan Browns, Da Vinci Code which was thought to put Christian beliefs and theology into question by a bigoted few fanatical Catholics.
Freedom is having the right to choose.
