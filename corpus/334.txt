Water fast is good once a week. It actually helps your body to ged rid of food, water, toxins etc. it recleans it. You will drop maybe 3 lbs during 1 day water- fast, but it will be mostly water- 2 lbs of water, food etc. and 1 lbs of fat. 

It works, but as i said, not more than once per week. It boosts your metabolism too, but dont pig out the fallowing day.
