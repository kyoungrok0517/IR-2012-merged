I suggest you check up the website of the justly famous American Tibetan-Buddhist nun Thubten Chodron. Her website is filled with information on all aspects of Buddhism and Buddhist practice, and especially helpful is maybe her collected resources on different kinds of meditation: 
http://www.thubtenchodron.org/Meditation/index.html

In your case, of course her teaching on "Dealing with Depression" is particularly relevant:
http://www.thubtenchodron.org/DealingWithEmotions/dealing_with_depression.html

Or just start searching from scratch here:
http://www.thubtenchodron.org/


I also strongly agree with the recommendation of Lama Thubten Yeshes (that's one of the main teachers of Thubten Chodron, by the way) book "Becoming Your Own Therapist", or any other title by that incomparable master. You can find information about his books in print (most of them free!) and/or available online here:
http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php

Another book you might try is "How to Overcome Depression" by another famous Tibetan master, Sogyal Rinpoche:
