I'm doing a project, and it is comparing the 1920's to today. 
I was wondering if anyone knew any good sites to find information on today. I already have plenty of info on the twenties. Your help would be greatly appreciated :)


Obviously I know what's going on today, but my teacher wants a work cited list so she knows we didn't pull the info out of thin air.
