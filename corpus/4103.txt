Rock.

Volcanoes occur when the molten rock from inside the earth gets out. When it is molten and still inside the earth we call it magma, when it is still molten but already flowing outside we call it lava. After it has cooled of we call it basalt which is basically a kind of rock ( dark, almost black looking) 

Since the volcano keeps bringing more and more lava, the stuff piles up and forms a mountain ( read : the volcano) so the mountain of the volcano it made of layers and layers of cooled lava. 
And since lava is molten rock .....
