GRRR!!! 

Communism opposed Tsarism extensively (that was half of the Bolshevik purpose)!
The USSR wasn't Communist politically or economically. It was a State Capitalist Fascism!
The last Tsar was nixed before the 1917 Revolution!
Communism has never existed to this point except in the Communes of Paris!

I'd go on, but I feel as if this is sufficient for now. This question is ridiculous. Just because the USSR, China, and the US say that the USSR and China are Communist, doesn't mean they are or ever were!
