Hello,

Serious hair loss can be caused by any number of factors from genetics, to major stress, hormonal imbalance, thyroid problems, poor health, etc. While I'd venture to guess that stress may be the key cause in your case it's hard to know for sure. To really get a handle on what's happening and finding a way to fix it, I'd suggest scheduling a free consultation with a Bosley physician at one of our many regional offices (all listed on our website).

Our people are hair loss experts who can diagnose the specific cause of your case & recommend appropriate treatment options. Best of all, the consults are conducted free of charge so at the very least you receive the information you need to move forward in addressing your problem without having to spend a dime for it. Again, I think this would be a good first step for you and neither you nor your family will have to worry about any major bills from it. Best of luck to you
