Radiation comes in three flavors: alpha, beta, and gamma. The first two are particles and shielding from them is relatively simple, so generally when you talk about radiation shielding you are worried about gamma radiation. Gamma rays are high-energy photons that easily penetrate most surfaces, so various thinknesses of steel or lead are usually used to shield from gamma rays. Another concern is that humans might be brought into direct contact with radioactive substances, such as tracers or radiation-therapy sources.
