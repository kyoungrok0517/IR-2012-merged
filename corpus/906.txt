I have a ticket signed by Danny Boyle to the first screening of the movie at the Toronto International Film Festival 2008 where it had it's first screening in its final cut. It went on to win the People's Choice Award at the festival, which led it to much bigger awards in the future. Today it is one of the biggest box office (cost-profit ratio) and awards successes (only second film to receive all major industry awards, and Golden Globes) ever made.

I'm not looking to sell it, I was just wondering.
