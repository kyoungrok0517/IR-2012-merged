they saved money and didn't expect the gov to bail them out, imagine that! and they worked relatively longer into their lives, When FDR started social security you got it when you were 63 and the life expectancy was 63. Now people start to get social security in their 60's but usually live into their 70's. if we lived like people did before social security we wouldn't retire until we were in our mid 70's
