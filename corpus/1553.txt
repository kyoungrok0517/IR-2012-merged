It does depend on your lifestyle and what you plan to spend your money on. Will your home/auto/finances be paid for? Or will you still be making payments? take that into consideration. Also, the fact that in the future, prices will more than likely rise and the value of the dollar may not be exactly what it is today.

I would invest into a Whole life policy or an IRA and just keep dumping as much money as you can into it each year. don't even pay attention to the market...just keep putting money in it. The market is going to fluxuate regarless. Ask an agent. They'll help.
