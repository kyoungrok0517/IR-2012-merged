LIFE CONSUMES LIFE
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Life consumes Life
Take it for what it’s worth
Birth begs to be fed
Earth ate the dead
No matter what the spread
Iron Oxide rust red
“Life consumes Life” I said
Phage out numbers all of life combined
Bores into bacteria 
Consumes until it dies
A Murder of crows to pick out the eyes
An eating frenzy never satisfied 
Life is a banquet 
A cannibalistic feast
For everything is the fodder   
From the great whale to the hungered yeast
