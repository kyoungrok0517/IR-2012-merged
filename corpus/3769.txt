Hey there,
You are probably familiar with the usual tips of healthy eating, limiting to 1200 cals, drinking lots of water. But I have some easy and less known tips for you. 
- Vitamins, B ones specifically. I'd buy a B complex or just straight up Biotin. Take 5000mcgs daily. Not only will it help you "metabolize fats" but you obtain thick, faster growing hair, stronger nails, and gorgeous skin as well.
- Start drinking green tea, or taking supplements. It's AMAZING for you. It cleanses you (bye bye McDonald's meal you just ate). And does it's magic in more complex ways to minimize your waistline. I recommend looking it up. It has so many benefits it's far worth the small price tag. Even can prevent cancer? Hmm.
- LAST BUT NOT LEAST! My favorite trick in the book! Naturally tiny people who eat everything tend to be fidgeters. This has been studied by mayo clinic and it is NOT a coincidence! Take up fidgeting! You can burn upwards of 800 extra calories a day. Do you work at a desk? Sit up straight, bounce both of your legs rapidly on the balls of your feet. Try to do it all day. It will eventually come naturally. I've done my research and it's said on average it can burn up to 120 cals hourly!? While it may be irritating to the people watching you, it works wonders. There goes a big mac.
