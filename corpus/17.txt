OK here you go.... You only use a Serval to produce F1s. For all other generations you should use a fertile Savannah male which is typically an F5 or later generation. You do not want to use a Bengal. 

If you do breed a Savannah to a Bengal you can indeed register the kittens with TICA as either "A" Savannahs or "A" Bengals. With the "A" meaning they are a result of an outcross. Regardless if the outcross is permissible or not, they can still be registered although they will not be eligible to show and quite frankly, difficult to sell. I highly recommend you join some of the Savannah Yahoo Groups... there is much for you to learn if you want to do this right and be successful at it.
