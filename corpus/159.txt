There is zero  scientific evidence suggesting that anything will cause the world to end in 2012. People simply believe that it will end because the Mayan calender ended at the year 2012. Also, the reversing of the earth's magnetic poles wouldn't cause the world to end, that is a completely normal phenomenon that happens periodically every few million years or so.
