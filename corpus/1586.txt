$$'s are not worth what they used to be .. however if you can choose a low cost country $300,000 at todays value should be enough.

In 25 years inflation will have eroded the value of the $$ even further and countries like Philippines will have improved their standard of living (indeed they may even have started to impose entry restrictions to limit immigration in that time)  .. 

So all you can do now is save like mad and check your options every 5 years or so ..

You can be 100% sure that any bank restrictions will change in 25 years .. (BoA might even have gone bust :-) )
