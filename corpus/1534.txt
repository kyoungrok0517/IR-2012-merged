How come the Yankees just keep retiring so many numbers. They retired Reggie Jacksons number even though he only played with them for 4 seasons. They retired Thurman Munson's number just because he died while he was playing for them. Now i hear they might retire Joe Torres number and A-Rod and maybe Jeter. How long will it take until before the players have to start wearing triple digits on their uniform? Why do they need to retire so many numbers?
Whos number will they retire next?
