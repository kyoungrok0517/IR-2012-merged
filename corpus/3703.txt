You lie: you don't have any sympathy at all for Kate or Gerry McCann and have made that quite clear since Madeleine went missing.

Kate was not suffering from a mental disorder, her response was perfectly normal in the circumstances, so a psychaitrist would not have been able to help her at all.  She may since have seen a psychotherapist to help her deal with the difficult emotions she no doubt still experiences.
