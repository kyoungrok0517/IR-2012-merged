I like Mexican food. I'll have it 2-3x a week.
 I don't go for the culture, I like the simple ingredients, but if culture does play a part, I would say that a lot of restaurants will still use mortar and pestle to prepare the meals. this makes a big difference in flavor compared to a food processor.
So the answer is the traditional way of prepping food.
