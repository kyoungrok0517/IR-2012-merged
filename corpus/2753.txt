Dart frogs are much more advanced care wise than anoles.  They, like all frogs, are live prey only animals, they are enticed to eat food by natural motion, sound from vibration or unnatural motion will scare the daylights out of them and they will not eat, and will probably actively avoid the area of the feeding.

Anytime you house two species together you run risks, especially if you don't want to feed naturally.  I would recommend  no unless you have a lot of experience and a large set-up.  The dart frogs can actually poison the anoles, as well as the fact that anoles are arboreal and frogs are terrestrial.  The two also have very different habitat requirements.

Dart frogs eat pin head crickets and fruitflies, so hand feeding is not really an option, and that coupled with the fact that they are sensitive to vibration and asily scared, these are probably not the best pet for your situation.
