I'm considering starting to go to a tanning shop to use the sun-beds to get a sun-tan. And I have seen different answers from people around the internet so I figured I would ask here and see what replys I get.

Note: Do your best to give me a true reflection on how safe or unsafe sun-beds are to use without letting your personal opinion of the use of sun-beds make your opinion biased towards safe or unsafe.
