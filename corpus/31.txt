All the breeders I know have a support group near and far and keep in touch with each other and they also have breed groups on Yahoo where they can ask questions and get answers from the same breed of cat.  They do not come on Yahoo Answers and ask strangers who know nothing about their beloved breed on what to feed them.  They also know switching the food they feed is not very good to do.
