If you mean taking the exam for getting your real estate license, I'm almost certain that you have to sign up with one of the real estate companies in order to take the exam. You will have to undergo a class sponsored by the real estate company in order to take the exam, regardless of whether you could pass it on your own.  I believe most of them require that you work for them after taking the exam.
