Edison's greatest invention was himself.  He invented very little, he was a con man, a fraud, a thief and a cheat.  He did not invent the light bulb - all he did was steal Joseph Swan's design and try to patent it.  
Bell invented the telephone and Eastman simplified the photographic camera, making it cheaper and available to the masses.
