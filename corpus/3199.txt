I am currently doing a research on Cambodia's women of substance but I have limited knowledge about the country and the internet doesn't give much help. Maybe you guys got any ideas? 

ex.
Ros Sereysothea
She's a famous singer during the Khmer Rouge. She was given the title "Golden Voice of the Royal Capital."


Something like that.


** By any chance, might you have any ideas on Thailand and Laos as well?
