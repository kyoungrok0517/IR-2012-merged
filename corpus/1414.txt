In terms of conspicuity - All the studies say that day-glow yellow is best, followed by DOT orange, and that white is 3rd.

I wear white (no other decorations). And the reason is the physics of light. The darker the (base) color, the more your helmet becomes a solar heat collector. Since we all tend to ride more in summer, and often into very hot climates, I choose white. Because it reflects the most light, and collects least amount of heat over its surface. If it is a 100*+ F in the shade, I am already hotter than I want to be..........   ;-)
