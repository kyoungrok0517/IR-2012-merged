I'm a single mom, and money is tight. I am looking into Edvest for my son(he is one), what are the pros and cons? Also, I have very little extra money to save for his future, are savings bonds a good way to go? This way, I can buy a couple a month, and know he will have something besides a college fund. There are a few types of savings bonds, which would suit my purpose?
