While most people think that Frank “Home Run” Baker held the single season and career home run records prior to Babe Ruth, that is not correct.  Baker led the league in homers four times, but never held the single season or career records.  In 1901 (the beginning of the “modern” baseball era), the single season home run record was established at 16 by Sam Crawford of the Cincinnati Reds (later of the Detroit Tigers).  That total was matched in 1902 by Socks Seybold of the Philadelphia Phillies.  The two shared the single season record until 1911, when Frank “Wildfire” Schulte of the Chicago Cubs hit 21.  That record was eclipsed in 1915 by Gabby Cravath of the Philadelphia Phillies, who hit 24 round-trippers that year.  Ruth took the record in 1919, hitting 29.  He never looked back, hitting 54 in 1920, 59 in ’21 and 60 in ’27.  The record of 60 stood 34 years until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961 (Ruth held the record a total of 42 years).  Maris held the single season title for 37 years until Mark McGwire hit 70 in 1998.  That record fell to Barry Bonds three years later, when the current home run king hit 73 in 2001.  Baker never hit more than 12 homers in any one season.

As for career records, again starting in 1901, Crawford set the initial mark in 1901 with 16.  Seybold took the lead in 1902 with a career total of 24 to date. Buck Freeman of the Boston Red Sox (they were actually called the Americans or the Pilgrims for all but one of Freeman’s seven years in Boston) took the lead in 1903, ending the season with 36 career homers.  Freeman kept the career lead until 1907 when he was surpassed by Harry Davis of the Philadelphia (now Oakland) Athletics.  Davis finished that year with a career total of 58 homers.  Davis finished his career with 69 “modern era” homers (he had 75 total) and held the lead until 1913 when he was surpassed by Sam Crawford, now with the Detroit Tigers, who holds the distinction of being the only player ever to hold the career home record twice.  Crawford retained the career home run lead until 1916, when he was surpassed by Wildfire Schulte, who finished the season with 91 career homers.  Schulte was passed the next year, 1917, by Gabby Cravath who finished with 98 home runs that year.  Cravath ended his career in 1920 with 119 round trippers.  In 1921, Ruth hit 59 homers, extending his career numbers to 162 and easily surpassing Cravath on his way to a career total of 714.  Ruth held the career record for 53 years (from 1921 to 1974) when he was surpassed by Aaron.  Aaron held the record for 33 years.

So how many of these record-setting home run hitters are in the Hall of Fame?  Only three:  Ruth, Aaron and Crawford.  One non-record-setter made it, however:  Frank “Home Run” Baker.  I guess it helps to have a nickname and, of course, to play in New York.  As they say, “perception is reality.”

p.s.  Connor (who is in the Hall of Fame) and Williamson both played exclusively in the 1800's when fields, rules, competition and schedules were all irregular.  Not to discount their acheivements, but not an apples-to-apples comparison with the modern era.
