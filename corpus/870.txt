By saying that the proper name in Mexico for "rolled tacos", the name used in the U.S.A. for supposedly Americanized Mexican food is truly "FLAUTAS", and it's preparation method , consistency and flavor seldomly resemble the original homemade Mexican dishes,.  I'm still on the prowl for authentic homemade Mexican food, and up to know, no such luck, only at my mother's house.
