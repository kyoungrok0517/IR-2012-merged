Do NOT allow your husband to take steroids just to build muscle! (It's a totally different story if a doctor is prescribing them due to a medical condition, but it sounds like this is not the case.) He should eat right (a lot!), lift heavy and smart, and there are plenty of safe and legal supplements that he can take that won't do the damage to his health that steroids will do. Creatine, glutamine, amino acids, protein supplements . . . you name it. If he does his homework on this and is willing to work hard in the gym and be strict about his diet, then he will build plenty of muscle naturally and safely.
