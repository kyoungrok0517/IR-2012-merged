I found two bull frogs and two small frogs ( I don't know what kind they are) I bought them a bag of crickets from a pet store by my house.

well the other day, I looked in the aquarium and their were only three frogs, one of the bull frogs ate one of the smaller ones.

I wouldn't recommend you putting them in the same aquarium together.
