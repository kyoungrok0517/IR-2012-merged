We recently cruised out of New York and it was a nightmare!  We sat directly in front of the cruise terminal in our car for hours waiting for everyone to get parked.  Does anyone know if Baltimore is like that?  We have always cruised out of Port Canaveral before with no parking issues.  Any advice on the Baltimore cruise terminal would be appreciated!!  Thank you!
