Honey cannot be given to children under the age of 1 because of the fact that it may contain trace amounts of the botulism toxin, which can kill babies. Their immune system isn't strong enough to fight the toxin off and they can get really sick or die. Check a bottle of honey...they always have a warning about it on the label.
