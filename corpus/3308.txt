What first amendment rights?  In attending a public or private school, you have agreed to abide by the rules the school has established.  There is no discussion on the matter.  They make the rules and you follow them or you look for another school.

I think that there are many schools that would benefit from a uniform dress code.  The people who claim that having to at least try to fit into the school is a violation of their rights seem to be generally sociopathic to begin with.  "I won't fit in because I don't WANT to fit in!" about sums it up.

Let's start real world training before graduation.  "Fit in or get out."  If fitting in means dressing the same, or if it requires dressing the same to accomplish, then so be it.  School should be a team happening.
