i was taught swerve for an animal no mater whaT ,,,because of what you are talking about...but i do no that when i see a squirl or rabbit...i dont want to hit it so i swirve to miss it ..but i gotta say the bigger the animal the more we will react ..in alaska a mosse will crush a car..and a deer will just break a windshield and dent the hood ...either way you should hit it straight on and not swirve ...i hope this helps ,but its only an opionion...mmmkay
