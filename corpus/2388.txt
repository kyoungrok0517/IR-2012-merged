There are 50 to 100 earthquakes in that general vicinity every week. None have been at that exact point, and for the past week, perhaps none have been close enough or strong enough to have been felt.

See this web page for an earthquake map of that area.

The earthquake.usgs.gov web site has tons of maps, lists and information about events, especially in CA.

There is _no way_ to predict exactly when or where an earthquake will occur, nor how strong it will be. The only thing you can do is to follow earthquake preparation guidelines for things like gas appliances, and keep an emergency kit close at hand at all times.

If you like it there, and have a chance to live there - go ahead and do it. You might be hit by a bus next week and be dead anyway, so make plans to enjoy things that you like.
