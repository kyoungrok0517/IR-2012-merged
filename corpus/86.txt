You probably don't feel it anymore. I was that way when I first went through recovery. *hugs*
But for a typical person, hunger feels like a growling in the stomach, like a hamster is in your tummy rolling around. If it prolongs, it becomes a sort of burning feeling below your chest, in the middle. Just above your stomach. That's when the gastric kicks in and if you continue not eating, you'll burn a hole in your stomach. 

When you're hungry all you think about is eating. Some people get grouchy, some people get tired / sleepy.

As for cravings, it's like a need to eat a certain type of food. I don't get that, so I wouldn't know. But i have friends who are bullimics and get cravings all the time. I think it's like a strong urge to eat a certain type of food that is very hard to succumb?

I don't think you'll experience these yet, because no one I knew from recovery did. Until they fully recovered. The whole ed thing makes you immune to hunger, so... take your time love, you will get it after awhile.
