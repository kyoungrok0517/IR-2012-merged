As long as you keep it within some kind of retirement account its tax-deferred.  If you cash it out or put it into anything outside of a retirement account, such as regular mutual funds, it becomes taxable.  When you retire and leave the company you can roll a 401k over into an IRA and make withdrawals from it.
