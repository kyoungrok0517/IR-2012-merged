I'm not sure if men let the women go to safety first to gain social currency.  They just wanted their wards to be safe.

Since my BDSM lifestyle role gives me some similar mentality to that of olden days men, I'd like to point out that, when you have someone who is yours, you're quite protective of them.  It'd be far worse to let your girl die than to die yourself.  It's more or less the same feeling as losing a child.   (Actually, it's almost exactly the same, being why it was women -and-children, not one then the other.)
