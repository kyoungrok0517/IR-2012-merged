It depends on the person and how healthy they are at certain weights. There isn't any set BMI that I know of, though usually around BMI 17 or so is when it starts from my experience/knowledge.

I had pretty severe anorexia for years- I think I still had my period at BMI of 13.5-14ish, but later on after regaining and losing some weight I stopped getting it when my BMI was around 16.5. It finally came back when my BMI got up to around 19.
