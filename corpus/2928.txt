It's not that they would hate to live in America. They are hating because they CAN'T live in America. It's been a lot harder to get over here these last few years and I'm sure it's rubbed some people the wrong way. Plus their assertions are probably based off of the media's inaccurate interpretation of America. Why is it the same people who complain are the same people who live here and make no effort to go back to where they came? Interesting.
Player haters. Pure and simple. If you don't want to live here, GOOD! More fun and opportunity for us native born Americans.
Edit: comrade whatever: my point exactly. Blah blah blah complain complain but answer me this: Where do you live!!!!!
Enough said!!! :p
