I want to buy savings bonds for my children,what is the best way to go about doing that,through a bank like Bank of America,and how much is the minimum to put in there.I really don't know anything about them i just heard it would be a good investment and that you can put a time limit to it like they can't cash it out till they are 21 if you wish or older,what is the best way to start looking into that investment,or any suggestions on what i can set up like that?
