before tonight i had just observed that most of the highest revered authors all had suffered from depression so i finally decided to look into it and it seems that im right throughout history many of the greatest writers or artists had suffered from depression. so i guess what im asking is which comes first the creativity or the depression? i myself have depression issues and i am a very talented writer apparently because of it? my depression started when i entered my teens..i dont remember how i wrote before that time so i cant tell from personal experience if the depression came first of the creativity did, so if it was the creativity first why does this cause depression and so many people and vice versa if the depression came first then how did it cause creativity? depression is hell and depression is insight.
