hello

the disease had an exceptionally high death rate,around 95% , so in general the fittest/healthiest had a chance of survival 

most methods taken to end the disease were not successful

but there were methods that did work:
 - In Milan, to take one of the most successful examples, city officials immediately walled up houses found to have the plague, isolating the healthy in them along with the sick. 

- Venice took sophisticated and stringent quarantine and health measures, including isolating all incoming ships on a separate island. 

But people died anyway, though fewer in Milan and Venice than in cities that took no such measures. 

- Pope Clement VI, living at Avignon, sat between two large fires to breath pure air. The plague bacillus actually is destroyed by heat, so this was one of the few truly effective measures taken.

there are theories that the black rats were the carriers of the disease, but the brown rat is a lot more aggressive ... and therefore where they resided the black rats never gained a foothold , and therefore the disease never spread

in the end basic hygiene ended the disease ... people washed their hands, avoided dirty water , burnt the dead, or buried them deeply
