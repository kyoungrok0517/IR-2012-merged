Man, if this is real and not "Satire" as you claim the Republicans are in trouble.  I don't know whether to hope it is satire or hope it is real, either way this country is messed up.

The scary part is that the 9,9,9 plan is exactly the kind of gag that Spike Lee tries to put in all of his movies including the dramas.
