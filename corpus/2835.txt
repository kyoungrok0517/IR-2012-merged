They have a map on the wall in the office with a circle drawn on it in thick black pen. (The school is in the middle of the circle). 
When someone applies for a place, they find the road on the map and if it is inside the circle the application form gets a 'tick' and if it isn't , it gets a cross.
You also have to supply proof that you live there to some popular schools - like a utility bill - so that they know you're not cheating.
