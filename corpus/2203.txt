Yes, they are legal in countries outside the U.S.A
and many doctors will prescribe more than is needed
or even when it's not needed for medical purposes .. Bad Doctors lol

Many people don't take the time to learn how to properly use them
which is where ABUSE comes into play and also how they get a bad
name to those uneducated about them.. Not to mention the media blowing
up everything to make it sound bad .. 

Once someone learns how to use them correctly, there are many benefits such as:

Increased Muscle Tissue
Increased Energy (some of this from increased RBC count) 
Increased SexDrive
Increased Collagen Synthesis (help strengthen bones, tendons, ligaments)
Increased Confidence
Heightened Sense Of Well Being
Decreased FatLoss
More Attention From The Opposite Sex
The list goes on

AND no it's not fake muscle
The penis increases in size because of increased RBCs, if changing at all
Aggression is increased but the heightened feeling of well being keeps this in control
and only comes out when it's need like if in danger or pushing through a grueling workout
