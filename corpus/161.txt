The world is no more likely to end in 2012 than in any other year. 

That said, may I second the request to knock off the remarks about Lady Gaga's and Justin Bieber's naughty bits? Justin Bieber's just the latest barely-pubescent teenage heartthrob to come along. They do that on a regular basis. He'll be popular for a while, and then he'll fade away and be replaced. As for Stefani Germanotta, a.k.a. Lady Gaga, it's perfectly well known and well documented that she's female. Remaking these stale jokes about them has become an excuse to say "penis" and "vagina" in a public thread, which is so dorky that words cannot express it.
