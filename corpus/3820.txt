Yes, I can see you're upset.  All those fullstops and caps!  I don't let national events fire my ire because we never get the full story and I don't want to get fired up over something that's going to change next week anyway (as we're in the hands of rank amateurs).  My ire is more likely to be fired by things I can have some control over, like teenagers who grunt at me and when Mr Sheila insists on eating at my desk.
