If your just starting out, and don't want to spend a lot, you can get a decent cue from companies such as Players, Schmelke, Adams, for under $100. Coming just above that, in the $100 - $200 you have companies like Viking and McDermott who make some good cues at some reasonable prices. Above that you have a lot of choices like Joss, Schon, Pechaur, etc and there are a lot of smaller local cue makers who put out some very good cues, these of course will vary by where and who makes them.

As for Predator, as the gentleman above me mentioned, well, I don't go around hitting the ball so hard as to generate the kind of flex he's referring to (except on the break). I've learned that pool is a game of finess and not power.

As for dimensions a typical cue will be 57-59 inches, 18 - 21 oz. with it's center of ballance around the top of the wrap.  It's more about what feels good to you.  One of the most important parts of any cue is the tip, many cues will come with a LePro tip, my advice, cut it off and get a new one put on, Tiger, Talisman are good intermediate tips for a beginner, also, you can get them in soft, medium, or hard.  Also it's important to keep your tip in good shape, invest a few dollars into a good tip tool, keep the tip ruffed up so that it holds chalk well, and you should do just fine.
