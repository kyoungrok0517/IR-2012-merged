I usually fertilize my orchids when I water them. But I have several in hanging baskets that I hang outside in the summer. It is awkward to fertilize them for a variety of reasons. Is there a commercially available slow release fertilizer that can be used for orchids? What product would you use? And how do you use it? Mix it in with the medium? Sprinkle it on top?
