It is the only cruise I've been on and it was fantastic. They do treat you like royalty. Food was great. So much to do while on board. The entire crew and staff were very nice. I was on Sovereign of the Seas. We went from Miami to Nassau and CocoCay. There were 17 of us in my party and we all had a blast. Enjoy
