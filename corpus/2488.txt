Ok first of all go trick or treating!!! you get candy and you don't even have to say "TRICK OR TREAT" or anything just ring the doorbell

then also watch some scary movies or if you don't feel like getting them go on you tube and watch scary videos!!!

Plus have friends over it makes Halloween 5x more fun!!!!
