Who are good pool cue suppliers and what pool cue to go for?
ive recentlt bought a 6 by 3ft pool table but it came with really short sticks and im wanting to invest in a pool cue under 50-Â£60 just need some help on finding where to buy online and preferbly a decent make model.

ive been looking at reviews i few mention not to go with cuetec?
