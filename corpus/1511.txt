I am thinking of enrolling in my employer's payroll savings bond programme. I anticipate making a proposal to creditors and/or declaring bankruptcy in a year. Is money I invest in the savings bonds protected at all? Does it make a difference whether I buy the bonds for myself, jointly, or for another person?
