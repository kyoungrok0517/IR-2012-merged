I'm a naturally thin person (I'm 5'5" and normally about 100 lbs.), but I'm also very athletic.  During the cross country season I'm often 108-110 lbs. because muscle weighs more than fat.  Whenever I calculate my BMI it says that I have a higher percentage of body fat when I'm more in shape, even though I know this is not accurate.  Is there a BMI calculator available that can distinguish between fat and muscle?
