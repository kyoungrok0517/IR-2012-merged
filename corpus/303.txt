it's not a solution to depression, would you be friggen happy while fasting?
people dont do it for joy ya know.
they do it as a sacrifice and/or to cleanse the body from sins.
it deff wont energize the body a healthy diet will do that.
what may energize the body is feeling good about yourself, do some church work, pray, i dont know but fasting isnt right buddo.
