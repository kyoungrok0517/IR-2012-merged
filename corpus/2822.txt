I'm looking for any surveys done, such by AARP or some other organization, to identify what criteria Boomers say they use (or will use) when choosing where to live after retirement. By criteria I mean things like warm weather, promixity to health care, affordable housing...that sort of thing. I can guess what the criteria might be, but it would nice to see a survey that validates (or disproves) my thoughts. This is research for a book.

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciate. Thanks to all who contribute.
