And just weeks ago, the automotive media was falling all over them and giving them awards, just to give 0-bama a boost. Ford still outsells them by far, builds a better truck and is the only brand that I have in my business fleet and in my driveway.

Enjoy that "RAM-BOX" and "Hemi-powered V-8" while your heap is parked at the dealership for more warranty work! Meanwhile, my trucks are making me money.
