Firstly you need a radio that accepts traffic announcements, otherwise it won't work.

I think the radio station sends an inaudible signal to tell the radio in your car that a traffic announcement is starting and one at the end to tell it the announcement has ended. Although there is sometimes a delay before it switches back to CD or whatever.

With the basic systems it will only detect traffic announcements for the station it is tuned into (the one you listen to last before switching to CD or whatever).

More advanced units with EON can detect the signal from other stations but not all. 

It can be turned off by pressing a button TA or TP. You will notice that TA or TP will be displayed on the radio when it is on, but this disappears when it is swtiched off.
