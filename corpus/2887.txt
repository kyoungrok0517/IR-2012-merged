Houston: First word heard from the moon. The nation's fourth largest city and home to the Texas Medical Center (the world's largest) and NASA's Johnson Space Center.

Few cities in the world can match H-Town as a source for blues and rap talent. Home of ZZ Top and Beyonc√©.

One of the best places to live, work, play, eat, play music, hear music, do art, see art, get sick, get well, work out, hang out, and make a decent living doing whatever your heart says you were put on earth to do.

ex) The U.S. economy can be up or down but there's always money to be made in Houston.
