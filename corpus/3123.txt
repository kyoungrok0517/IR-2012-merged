BMI is very inaccurate and is an outdated tool developed by the government to track statistical data.  It does not take into account body composition, so most elite athletes with extra muscle mass and little bodyfat will register high on the scale, and anorexics low on the scale.

The best thing to do is get your bodyfat percentage tested.  You can do this yourself with hand calipers, or find someone to do it for you (many health clubs have this service).  Impedence scales and other such devices are very inaccurate, so calipers are your most accurate and viable means (total water immersion is actually the most accurate but not viable for most people).
