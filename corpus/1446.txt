Basic helmet construction is designed to do the following;

- dissipate the impact force over a large area
- absorb the shock of the impact
- prevent penetrating injury to the skull.
- it also prevents abrasion injuries

 In other words the helmet is considered a sacrificial secondary skull that is designed to absorb injury inducing blows and fail before the impact causes damage to the skull and brain.

CASE IN POINT - I have a helmet hanging on my garage wall that has not had the buckle undone since the day I put it on to go for a cruise. And the reason I never had to unsnap it is because the helmet is split into two equal halves. I was rammed by a road rager and went over the hood of her car to a one point landing on the top of my head at which point the helmet was destroyed. I was left in the middle of the road wearing only the foam helmet liner. What was left of the shell was sitting behind me.

 Now; at that point in my life I weighed approx. 175 pounds and I impacted solid pavement with the crown of my head. The only injury I suffered was to my knees because they were the next points of my body to impact the ground. I did not have so much as a headache or a stiff neck.

 In another incident my bike suffered a steering head failure and pitched me onto the highway at over 80 MPH. The helmet I was wearing that day was surrendered to an insurance company safety instructor who uses it in his classes. This helmet was a brand new BELL full face unit and it has road rash holes worn through it along with a major impact crater from hitting a guard barrier beam. Not one square inch of this helmet escaped some form of damage as I tumbled quite some distance down the road before stopping.

 Again; absolutely no head trauma although the road rash on my arms did take a year to seal itself up.
