Do you know the definition of fasting?  Fasting is giving up food or something else--and spending the time you would be eating or doing that something else, with God.  Fasting is a means of drawing closer to God.  It is meant to purify us.  When you fast, you ARE sacrificing for God.  Right now, my church has entered a 50 day fast for 50 souls---for our Easter play.  We have a calendar up front where you can sign your name on what days you want to fast.  We are fasting for souls to be saved--whether it be at our play, at our church, or not.  We just want souls saved!  We're fasting because God called us to.  It is bringing us closer to the Lord.
