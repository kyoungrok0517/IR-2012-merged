You can't "get out" of your loan and just walk away and expect them to mail you a check for your equity .  If you walk away, the bank will foreclose, which requires attorney fees that are generally assessed back to you or against any value you have in the property.  When you walk away, you walk away from everything, including any value/principal in the property.
