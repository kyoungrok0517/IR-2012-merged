The largest cause of death in this type of accident is when the driver tries to avoid the deer and winds up flipped over and in the trees. There is a small possibility that the deer will go through your windsheid at high speeds over 50MPH. But you are far more likely to die by loosing control of your vehicle attempting to avoid the deer. This is a huge problem on I-10 between Laffayette, LA and Baton Rouge, LA I drive this route almost daily and have witness numerous accidents of this type. Check out NHTSA website for the exact numbers, but the summary says this almost word for word.
