I support the ban!!  If it were me, I'd put the ban into affect right now.  Fixtures don't require incandescent bulbs, they just say that. In my grandma's house some of her fixtures said "incandescent bulb required", but I put florescent in them & they work just fine. One of them was the kicthen stove hood, & the florescent has been in there more than a year, & is brighter than the other. As for your closets, paint them a real light cream color, white, or any really light color.
