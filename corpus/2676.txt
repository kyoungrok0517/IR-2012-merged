well ive been in this same situation except im 16 and shes 16. its weird but  dont read from books. if anything do what you think is right. i offered to buy a pregnancy test. and then if she really was pregnant. well that either way she would have to tell her mom. i know thats not what they want to do . but thats what they have to do.
