Your logic:

Because you cannot collect a fine from a volcano, the federal government should not regulate business and individuals who pump pollutants into the air our families breathe.  Instead they should let the private sector decide if they should poison the air, so long as it is profitable, regardless of the health effects on their neigbors children.  If our kids and other family members get sick and die that's good for the economy.
