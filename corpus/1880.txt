I am a junior in high school and I have been assigned to read a passage from "Dead Man's Path" by Chinua Achebe, in search for all rhetorical techniques utilized by the author.

The passage starts with "Michael Obi's hopes were fulfilled much earlier than he had expected." What literary technique is this? When the author begins by talking about a random character and situation not yet introduced, then goes back and writes about what led up to it. It's not induction, nor deduction...

I know all AP English classes are different, therefore all literary devices studied by each class will differ as well. 

An example of some of the techniques we're studying:

Allegory, allusion, anaphora, alliteration, apostrophe, chiasmus, cliche, connotation, and denotation, to name a few.

Please help! Thank you:)
