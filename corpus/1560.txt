I assume 401k is pension? In 35 years $85k will probably be the equivalent of $10,000 today but it's very hard to predict.

For your top-up investments - in the UK the rule of thumb is 100,000 for every 3,000 of annual income required.

This allows for income + some capital appreciation so you can keep up with the cost of living, otherwise you income will be eroded. Hopefully you will live a long time after 60 - at least 40 years - so you need plenty of money to enjoy yourself.

You are very wise to act now - I'm 42 and have probably missed the boat! I'll be lucky to retire at 60.
