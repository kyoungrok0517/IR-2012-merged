I have had an angiogram before when I had a heart condition. If they do notice something in the angiogram, then angioplasty will be needed to unblock the artery. Don't be scared though. It is good and it will help. Heart conditions are scary. I did get permanent heart damage from my condition, but I am okay. I still have heart pains when I get stressed out but I was told that would happen. Be positive and I hope your dad does well.
