The cloud model of the electron orbital:

1) Describes the wave-like nature of the electron in orbit around the nucleus, versus the
    Bohr model which was more like planets orbiting a sun. 

2) Can be thought of as a representation of the probability of finding the electron at
    any point in the space around the nucleus. 

3) The orbitals can be described by the Schrodinger equation for each atom.  

4) Each orbital is defined by a different set of quantum numbers, which tell us about
    the electrons angular momentum, and the shape of the orbital. 

5) The change to the cloud model can be considered a direct consequence of quantum mechanics
    and Heisenberg uncertainty, which dictates that the electron in its orbit cannot have an exact 
    location in space.
