USDA offers a loan program based on rural financing. There are median incomes used to qualify as well as number of people who live in the home. USDA loans do not require mortgage insurance and you can finance up to 102% of the property. The loans are even transferable. Please contact me if you would like to know more about it. Credit scores for these loans start at 600.

I am a mortgage banker in Texas. This can also qualify you for the first time home buyers tax credit.
