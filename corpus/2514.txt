There were no costumes when I was a boy, you had to make do with one of your mothers old dresses or something similar and a burnt cork to blacken your face.  A touch of your mother's lipstick put the finishing touches.  However, there were other things:

Halloween Barmbrack.

At Halloween we had Barmbrack,
The memory, it takes me back,
To happy days of innocence,
 When a bag of sweets cost just two pence.

The dressing up, from door to door,
‘Apples or nuts’ the children implore,
With faces black from cold burnt ash,
Still there next day, after a wash.

The Barmbrack was a special treat,
It looked too good to dare to eat,
The prizes cooked deep within,
The thought it made my young head spin.

A small brass ring that shone like gold,
The secret that its finding told,
That you would be the first to wed,
If you clung to it all night in bed.

A matchstick meant you would see the light,
That you would  know wrong from right,
But best was last, a thruppenny bit,
That you’d be rich, if you found it.

Such silly things, to a small boy,
Used to bring unending joy,
Now all that’s left is the memory,
Of the beautiful times that used to be.
