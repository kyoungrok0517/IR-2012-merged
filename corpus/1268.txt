I'm not certain about this, but my understanding is that cell phones typically get the time from the network they are on - say Verizon/AT&T. Or at least get periodical updates from the network they are on. They do not get it from either the GPS satellite or the WWV radio

For some technologies, like CDMA, there is a fairly tight correlation between time and the technology, so for those phones, getting the correct time is a lucky side-effect.
