the only other way i could think of charging it would be with a portable 12v charger or something, which you'd have to leave to chanrge itself overnight in your house.

As for the cigarette lighter problem (much easier way of charging) would be to look in your cars hand book (THICK one) and find the fuse section, find the fusebox, and find where the cigarette lighter fuse is, and simply take it out and check it. If it's boke, add a new one :p if not, there's probably a bad/broke connection somewhere in which case you could be brave and follow the wires into the dashboard... or take it too a garage. I can't say on a price though i'm afraid :/ If it is a bad connection, my thoughts are it'd be quite pricey wherever you go, as the wiring harness, is eveyones least favorite part to fix and work on in a car. it's SOOOO complicated. This usually reflects in the price. Go round and quote some prices first though. I mean, if someone can do i for 150 less then theres no contest. :) hope i helped :)
