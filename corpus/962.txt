I'll eat my best hat if Jennifer Aniston ever gets pregnant!! Her body is (always has been!) more important to her than a...a....a mere CHILD! She won't adopt either......why bother looking after a child when you have your own poolside sunning and parties to attend to? And then there's work. Goodness, it's not as if the woman is rolling in millions of dollars!! She has to keep on working to support herself! (joke)

There has always been stories of JA being pregnant regularly hitting the mags over the last 20 years. These stories usually coinside with a drop in her popularity, or when she needs to plug a new movie. Yep, I've seen the latest headlines too - take them with a grain of salt (like all the other 'pregnancy' stories.)

The truth is, she's never wanted children, and now - she's too old anyway!

P.S. - And she's probably cheated on more than one boyfriend in her life. She pretends to be the sweet all-American gal, but she's as cunning as a ****house rat! (It's all about Jen!)
