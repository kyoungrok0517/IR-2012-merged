I would hit the deer directly on.  If you try to avoid it, you will likely lose control of your vehicle. Also, if you damage your vehicle while avoiding the deer, that falls under your collision on your insurance--at fault.  If you hit the deer it is considered not at fault.  WE live in an area heavily populated with deer and moose.  I would hit a deer head on...I would probably swerve to avoid the moose.. LOL!
