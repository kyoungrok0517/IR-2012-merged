--Yellow is the most visible color for motor vehicles.
--When you're out riding, pretend that you're invisible.
That way, if someone hits you, it's your fault, cause they didn't see you.
--Always leave yourself a way out.
Keep an imaginary bubble between you and other drivers.
If someone invades your space, you have an exit plan in your mind and can react without thinking.
--Get the big picture.
Don't just look at the tail lights of the car in front of you.
Scan the road 1/8 - 1/4 mile ahead of you to be prepared for potential accidents.
Watch for cars waiting at cross streets, coming out of parking lots, waiting at an intersection about to make a left in front of you.
Pedestrians and kids between cars, that can jump out in an instant.
Red lights up ahead, or traffic jams - the driver in front of you could be on his cell phone, or just day dreaming and lock up his brakes at the last minute.
--These are good safety tips for automobile drivers as well.
