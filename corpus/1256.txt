bcoz without it the gps receiver can never get the accurate travel time of the signal from the gps.

since the transmitted signal contain the  transmitted time. So on receiving the signal at a particular time, it compute the travel time, hence the distance.

But for this to happen the receiver clock has to be synchronized with the atomic clock of the GPS.

How this is done is unclear to me.
