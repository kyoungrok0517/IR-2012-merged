To answer your question about : 
"How do people do feel now after they heard that they believe The End of the World suppose to happen"

Look up the long list of those who left other heretical cults after being enslaved to their false doctrines, and you will see they got stronger for having come out of such un-biblical teachings

Sometimes this is what it takes is to see that Jesus did not really come as predicted, or "the end" ...really wasn't "the end" , to find out the difference between a counterfeit group and the true teachings of the Bible.  Not all who use the Bible actually study it    

Moreover, most people don't like being lied to, and those same people still want the truth about Jesus Christ once they have cooled of from the lie they followed. 

Hope this helps.
