it's not wrong, it's an opinion, but i disagree. 

if a guy let me live i'd be grateful and relieved (nobody wants to die), but proud? i wouldn't think a guy were any less masculine if he pushed me off the boat and saved himself, i mean yea he'd be a huge asshole, but that has nothing to do with his masculinity.

i think what our society says is masculine is a joke. you don't have to hold doors open for us, you don't have to die for us, you don't have to do dick for us. gender equality is about just that- equality! it doesn't mean you can't treat women nicely, but you shouldn't treat them nicely just because they are women- you should do it because they are people.
