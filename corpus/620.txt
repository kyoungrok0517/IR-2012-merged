So I am planning to go photograph deer and was wondering if I would lay down onto the grass where they daily feed (I'd come an hour earlier...). I would camouflage myself and try staying as still as possible, There would be enough distance between me and the deer.

Anyone has some practical tips? Anything is more than welcome

Thanks,
Matic
