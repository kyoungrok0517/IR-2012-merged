I totally agree with you!

I'm from the UK, and we do have her in our Mags to.

She is obviously a very insecure Young Lady, who even with all her fame and money, STILL isn't happy with what she has got.

Her parents don't get along with her either!, She's damaged goods, i guess you could say!

She loved the attention she was getting when she was in Friends.Everyone Girl/Woman wanted to look like her, and every Man wanted to sleep with her.

She only won awards because people fancied her, not for her "acting ability", or lack of!
She moaned when people wanted her hairstyle, but was happy to take the cash from Loreal, to do the hair Adverts!

She's full of contradictions, a tortured soul i guess you could say.

Then she lapped up the attention when she married Brad Pitt!, But moaned when it went belly -up(went wrong; to translate!:)

She's turned into a Media Whore, and now wants people to leave her alone now that things are going very bad for her. Her Movies are boring, she can't act, never could!
