The 1500 is a 1/2 ton, the 2500 is a 3/4 ton and the 3500 is a one ton. You can get the 2500 and 3500 in the dually or singular rear wheels. The tonnage is the payload, or how much weight you can safely carry in the bed. The more payload, the more you can tow too. So if you plan on towing a boat or a trailer, find out the weight of it and buy your truck accordingly. 

The LT is the middle trim. It has standard features such as cloth split front seat, A/C, cruise, CD, fog lights, etc. The LTZ is the top of the line and has leather, bucket seats, dual power seats, XM, Onstar, etc standard. 

2 or 4WD? That's strictly up to you. It depends on your needs. If most of your driving is on city pavement, 2WD will do just fine. But if you live in snow or rain country, 4WD will come in very handy. As it will if you work in construction where you'll be on dirt and/or mud a lot. 

One last thing, if you do go with the 2500 or 3500 and you plan to do a lot of towing or hauling, you might want to get the Duramax diesel. It has a lot of torque and is the top rated diesel on the market.
