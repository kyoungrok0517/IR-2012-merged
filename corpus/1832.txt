first off buying a cue for someone isn't a great idea unless they help you pick it out.  every single cue is different,  have to make sure it has a good feel weight balance etc.

a decent cue will not have a screw on tip.  walmart cheapys are about the only thing that has screw ones.  and believe me it makes a huge difference. have played with screw ones and they don't have any consistency every shot is a lil different and doesn't feel like I'm in control.  i recommend u talk with him about what type cue he would like and take him shopping for one.  know it not as much fun not getting to see his face when he opens his presents but in long run it will be more appreciated
