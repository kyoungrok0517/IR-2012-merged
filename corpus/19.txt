And you think you can just buy an unaltered Savannah and start breeding on your own?  Not quite.  You need to first buy a show quality alter - which would cost SEVERAL thousand dollars, show it for awhile, mentor with a breed, and spend several thousand on showing for a few years.  Only after a few years of learning all you can about the breed and showing the breed would you be ALLOWED to purchase an unaltered Savannah with breeding rights.

So please - leave breeding to those doing so for the RIGHT reasons - for the love of and to better the breed.  What's yours?
