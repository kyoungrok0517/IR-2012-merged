Well, I went thru the same of what she's going thru believe is not easy I have a 9yrs old boy  I loving to death but honestly is not easy if she has future plans and if it wasnt with someone that she wants to stay or spend her life. I know is a lot of solutions but if she is an independent person that takes responsibility of her actions she should have it but if she's not like that I think she should think of other solutions specially if it's one night stand does type of experience dont take you anywhere is just mistakes in life and she doesnt want to have that baby as a mistake in her life.  You as a friend all you can do is give her support of any decision she makes thats what friends are for. Hopefully my advice works for you.
