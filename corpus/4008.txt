It just means that something (animals or plants) have been changed or tamed by humans for our use but not necessarily to kill.  Dogs are domesticated since we use them even thought they are not killed in most countries.  Cows are domesticated even though we sometimes only use them for their milk.  Camels and horses are used as transport and pack animals so they are domesticated.  They are probably eaten as well.
