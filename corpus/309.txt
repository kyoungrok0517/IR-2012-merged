I have fasted the past 2 Ramadan's and Insh'allah I will continue to fast each year.  For Muslims fasting is a way to get closer to Allah.  During Ramadan, you abstain from drink and food from dawn till dusk, and should read Quran and pray more during this month than any other.  Fasting makes you thankful of what you have and how fortunate you are compared to people who go hungry every day not just during Ramadan and other prescribed days of fasting.  Yes, the first few days are the hardest but after about 3 days or so it gets easier and you hardly think about food and such.  I guess in a way it can energize you, but to me it energizes the soul rather than the physical body.
