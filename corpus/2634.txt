I'm sure some movie will take in as much or more money than Titanic eventually, but as far as ticket sales I don't think anything will ever beat it. Even if Dark Knight were to overtake Titanic in gross, they still wouldn't have them beat in ticket sales, given that the cost of tickets has gone up so much in the last 10 years.
Factoring in today's higher admission prices, "The Dark Knight" would need to take in about $900 million to match the number of tickets sold by "Titanic."
