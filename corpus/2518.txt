My sister & I dressed up as Milli Vanilli...  We had mops on our heads & had dark foundation make up on.  We even did thier dance from "girl you know it's true" music video.  We got extra candy that year!  lol  The funny thing, is that we were little white girls who dressed up like grown black guys & no one was mad at us (that we know of).  We lived in Cleveland, Ohio then, & were the only white family on the block, so I guess thats why we were accepted?
