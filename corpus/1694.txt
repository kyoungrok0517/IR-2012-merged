My jaw is steadily becoming more painful and I've been getting tons of migraines because of my TMJ. Are there natural remedies for pain relief? I'd prefer any tips for TMJ self-care, because I don't want to take anything for it. I've heard of people doing exercises that provided TMJ pain relief, does anybody know of any?
