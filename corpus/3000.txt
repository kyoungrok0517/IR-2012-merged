They can do surgery that will rid the majority or all of the scar, but these can be very pricey!! But if you have good insurance, check into it. It's pretty painless.

If the scar is not too noticeable, I wouldn't even worry about it. But if it's something that has really been bothering you, go to a beauty store (or even a drug store) and find out what over the counter products you can use to make the scar not so noticeable. 

Also, I know Neosporin is for cuts, but I have heard that it works on scars as well (as far as reducing their appearance).
