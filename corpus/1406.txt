safety orange of course.

You can also wear a safety vest in orange with reflective tape. It may look stupid, but the Army makes their enlisted people wear it if they want to ride a bike.

You should, at th least, have a good Leather jacket and gloves. Boots are not as neccesary, unless you don't like broken ankles.

The best defense in the case of motorcycle riding safety is a good OFFENSE. Take a safety class for new motorcyclists and be active about looking for people about to change lanes into you, not yeilding to you at an intersection, pulling out of parking lots/spaces, etc.

Most riders are not a victim of their failure, but that of another driver in a car.
