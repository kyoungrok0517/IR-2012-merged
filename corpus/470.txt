They collect it in a cyber-vacum pump as it bubbles from the volcanoes of jupiter (the different colours develop according to the exposure to gases as it leaves the atmosphere).  The canisters are then transported to earth under very low pressure to prevent explosion.  This explains why the viewer becomes mesmerised watching the bubbles in a cosmic out-of-this-world experience.  I love them!!
