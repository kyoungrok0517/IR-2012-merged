Sir Hillary has just died of natural causes in New Zealand.
In tribute to his legacy, I'd like come up with this question: COULD HE BE JUSTIFIED AS GREATEST ADVENTURER OF OUR TIME?

Please be respectful in your comments, especially as this is about someone who has recently passed away.

PLEASE TICK STAR IF QUESTION INTERESTING
thanks for all answers!
