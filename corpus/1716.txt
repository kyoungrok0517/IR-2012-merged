Don't wait for it to get worse, my TMJ started out like that, and I let it progress for months. I finally got it looked at when the pain was so bad i could barely eat. I now wear a day bite plate, and a mouth guard when i sleep, it has helped me so much. I highly suggest you go to you're dentist, who should be able to give you the name of a good specialist.
