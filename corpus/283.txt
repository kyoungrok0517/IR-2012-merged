First of all, fasting in my opinion, is another way of praying.  Fasting is also something that you have to make the choice to do.  No one can force someone to fast.  I understand how you say that God already knows what is going on. Prayer is a way of communicating with God himself. You do not have to fast in order for your prayers to be answered, but you do have to have faith and believe in Him wholeheartedly devoting yourself to Him in order for Him to hear your prayers.  Remember, there is also a waiting period that may come in a short time or a long time, so be patient for the answers to your prayers.
