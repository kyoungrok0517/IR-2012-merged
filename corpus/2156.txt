One of two things, 1. The dog might be laying on cement it will pull the hair out.
2. It might be "RED MANGE" don't freak out all dogs have red mange if the dogs immune system is down or if the dog is under stress it might bring it on.
My Vet. told me to give my dog "IVERMECTION SOLUTION" by mouth 1/2 a cc. per. 5 lbs. for 45 days it helps my dogs, but call your vet before trying this.

GOOD LUCK!!
