Which Fuse?

Invest in a test light 5-10 $ at your local parts store. Using the test light check both sides of each fuse with the ignition on and the headlights on, the fuse which only lights the test light on one side is the bad one.  I do not recommend the "pull and peer" method because I have encountered fuses which were physically broken but not visibly blown.

If that fails to locate your problem then you need to find a mechanic to diagnose and repair your car.
