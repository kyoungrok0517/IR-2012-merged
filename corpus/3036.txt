I had a plastic surgeon remove 2 moles I had, one on each cheek, but it's been 4 months and a half now and the scar remains very visible, it actually seems the stiches didn't quite manage to join up both sides of my skin, so I have this small indentation running in between each side of the good skin, it doesn't look all that bad, but I wonder if anyone knows what to do to erase  this or at least make it better.
