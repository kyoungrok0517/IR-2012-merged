I have quite a few savings bonds that were bought by me and/or given as gifts for my kids for their education.  They have both graduated college and we did not use them all.  I would like to cash them and give the money to my kids, but I don't want to get socked with all that interest.  Can I reinvest the money into something so that it does not get taxed?
