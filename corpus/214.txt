It's impossible to predict the end of the world, unless by 100% scientific guarantee, which will never happen. Even if we do figure it out, we'll probably only have a few seconds to spread the news until a meteor the speed of light crashes and implodes our planet. In religion, the Bible states that no man can predict the end of the world, so in that case too the end is unknown. Just live everyday like your last damnit. That'll solve all your worries about this "end of the world."
