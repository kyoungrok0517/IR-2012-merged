Amitabh Bachchan is the brand ambassader of IIFA awards. If he is visiting Sri Lanka it doesn't mean he is supporting the brutality by some(not all) Sri Lankan people.

The sole purpose of conducting IIFA awards in a foreign country is to promote Indian movies in the world. It is being held every year in a foreign country having great demand for Indian movies.

The same can be said about Indian cricket team. If they are playing with Sri Lanka, it doesn't mean they are supporting Sri Lanka. Politics and Sports, entertainment are kept apart.

Edit : The people of Sri Lanka likes Indian movies and Indian stars. Why should they suffer because of their government's act. Just by visiting Sri Lanka, it doesn't mean that someone is supporting Sri Lanka.
