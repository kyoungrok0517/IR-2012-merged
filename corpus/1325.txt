I'm writing a book, and the main character's family moves her to Newport Beach from Eden Prairie, MN.  I need locations for events in the book. I've been to Newport Beach a few times, but I'm purely a tourist when I go.

I'm looking for anything that will help:  restaurants, malls, theaters, whatever.

Thanks in advance for the help!  ;)
