1) I am having trouble finding any empirical evidence that Moses of the Old Testament actually existed. 

The same would be true of almost anyone living in Egypt in the same period - unless they were somehow connected with the Pharaoh himself.  Go ahead - how many guys living in Memphis during the reign of Ramses II can you name?  How many **named people** living in Memphis at that time have "empirical evidence" of their existence?  Naturally, anyone living in Egypt at that time that you can't associate with their name is in the same boat as Moses!  (which would be nearly everyone living in Egypt, in case you didn't know).


2) Furthermore I'm having trouble finding out whether the majority of the claims were actually demonstrated.

I have no idea what that means.


From your language and the tenor of your own claims, it would seem that you are not very familiar with the basic concepts of history and archaeology.  It is no more surprising that we have no account of Moses outside of the Bible than it is that we have so many other ancient documents which mention otherwise unknown and unattested people.  It is the **norm**, rather than the reverse, that **ancient** documents record the names of people for whom **no other** evidence exists.  The exception is the rulers and highest officials within stable empires that have a penchant for the building of monuments.  In such societies, we have empirical evidence of those high-ranking leaders - but, usually, not of anyone else that we can connect with a name, despite the enormous number of people living in those empires for century upon century.
