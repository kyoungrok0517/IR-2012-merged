Crossing eras makes this a very difficult task, but you really have to do it. Babe Ruth played ball well beyond his era, when superstars were few and far between and opponents had no chance of even finding an answer to him. The gap between him and the next guy is what separated Babe Ruth from legends from most other sports. IMO, Michael Jordan is not the best basketball comparison here, because Wilt Chamberlain was much more a man among boys than Jordan was. Football had Jim Brown, as you mentioned, but otherwise there really wasn't the clear domination in the other sports. 

As far as icons go, Ruth, Jordan, Ali and Gretzky were indeed the keys to what made their sports what they are today. Where would each sport be without those guys? Football can't really claim one, as the college game was wildly popular before there was ever any Superbowl, yet it's the most popular in America. I think it would be fine had there never been a Jim Brown. Can't say the same for any of those other sports. 

However, Ruth is the only one out of all of them that can claim BOTH absolute domination and responsibility for his sport's place in today's culture. That makes him a little more prestigious, IMO.
