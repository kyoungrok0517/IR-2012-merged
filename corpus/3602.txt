Nope.  Tanning booths and beds are worse for your skin than the sun because you're in much closer proximity to the ultraviolet light source in a booth or bed than you are sunning on the beach or in your back yard.  It's very concentrated exposure, and because of that there's a much higher risk of developing skin cancer in a booth or bed.
