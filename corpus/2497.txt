You should have everyone come dressed up in a costume. Make sure to decorate your house. Bobbing for apples is actually originated with Halloween, so you might want to do that. Twister would be fun. Have plenty of food like hot wings, chips, salsa, taco dip, mozzarella sticks or pizza. Play really good music and have fun!
