I struggle to understand how people do not immediately bond with their baby as well but unfortunately it does happen through no fault of their own. 

I think this is more about the fact that you are not meeting your own needs. Join a mother and baby group so that you can chat with other mothers about anything and everything. Get your hair/nails done. Buy some new clothes. There is no reason why you can't treat yourself and enjoy life just because you have a new baby. Remember if your not happy your baby will pick up on that. Don't forget to enjoy life. Try to get out nearly every day. Even if it is just a walk to the shops. 

If there is no improvement then talk to your doctor or health visitor.
