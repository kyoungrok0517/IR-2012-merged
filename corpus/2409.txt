I frigging despise the IRS, but their reasoning is that you were allowed to defer taxes on that money as long as it remained in a tax sheltered account. If you take it out anytime before that, then you have to pay them an extra 10% to make up for them not being able to get their alotment of your wages earlier. 

It goes under the "time value of money" principal, best known by the phrase "a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tommorrow". It also helps people make the distinction between a true tax deferred account and a standard bank account. Unfortunately most people don't take the time to learn the distinction and that gives those fat pig fornicators a second shot at your cash.

It is awesome that you are starting to save money though. Remember the key is to let it build up over time and the more money that is in there means the earning power your account will have later in your career. The people that get started early in life have a significant advantage becuase of this. Starting early combined with responsible management (not taking loans or withdrawals, contributing as much as you can while still maintaning a lifestyle that does not have you drowning in debt) will often become a leaping to early retirement.
