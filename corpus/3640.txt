The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) offers a federally backed program that insures loans originated and serviced by qualified lenders. It was originated to help low-income and moderately low-income families buy homes of their own.

Instructions:
1. Contact an FHA-approved lender. Look in the yellow pages under Real Estate Loans/Mortgages, or search the Internet.

2. Shop around. Interest rates for FHA loans are set by the individual lenders, so rates vary.

3. Learn the specific income and credit qualifications for your area.

4. Know that the maximum loan amount is $151,725, but may be lower depending on where you live.

5. Complete a loan application.

 6. Provide the documentation required by the lender.

 7. Be prepared to pay a down payment of 3 to 5 percent, depending on where you live. (Closing costs are 2 to 3 percent of the purchase price, and most of that can be financed.)

8. Pay mortgage insurance. Because you may be putting down as little as 3 to 5 percent, you are required to pay mortgage insurance to cover the risk incurred by the lender. An up-front mortgage insurance premium is required and can be financed. The monthly mortgage insurance payments must be paid each month with the mortgage payment.

9. Complete the loan transaction.
