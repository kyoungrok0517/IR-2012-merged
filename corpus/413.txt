Apparently you already have made your mind.  In Deut 21:10-14 we read that the law did permit the Israelites to not kill the virgins and those who have not defiled themselves with sexual uncleanness.  Not every single member of the Midianite nation ended up being deserving of death.  Are you aware of the culture of the people that "Holy Moses" was killing off?  Or are you just trying to make a point?  The Midianites worshiped a god called Baal.  In this worship, which is sex worship, they appointed prostitutes to actually be at the temple so that sex orgies can be carried out in connection with the worship.  

They also sacrificed children to the God Baal and Astoreth as well.  They burned the babies alive in a fire.  Now, God was leading the nation of Israel out of Egypt and helping them become there own nation so that he can continue to keep safe the lineage from which the Messiah was to be born.  The Midianite seduced the Israelites to also get involved in this barbaric practice of sex worship and baby burning.  So, in order to protect the nation that will produce the world's savior God permitted Moses to carry out these acts.  Interestingly, the word "easter" comes from the word Astoreth, or Astarte, which is the goddess that they also worshiped.  Even the egg and the bunny comes from the sex worship that the Midianites carried out.

But, now that you have the facts, do you have the same opinion?
