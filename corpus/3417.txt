ATM, I prefer listening to Peggy Sue, 

but I have very fond memories of attending 
DeMolay dances in LA in the 70s.  If 
Donna was not my first slow dance, 
it certainly was quite memorable, perhaps 
because I was short.  

BQ:  I was just older than three years on 
that day, but I did like Don MacLean's 
American Pie quite a bit.
