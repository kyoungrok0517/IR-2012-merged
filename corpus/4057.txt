I do have the debris cover and was wondering if these "solar covers" really make a big difference.Are the debris covers designed to heat the water? I have a neck injury and the gravity freedom of water is SO helpful but the temperature of the water is almost counterproductive for results. Help me finf a way to get a little warmth.
