My experience lines up with what Rhubarb said.  Though I can't rule out the fact that I may have been the one to institute the waving action.  I see my friends passing in a car we'll wave.  If I see the parent of a student, the students wave.  The mother will usually give me the 'head bow'.  Clerks in the local grocery store see me when I come in and a couple of them always give me the 'head bow'.
