Exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed. When tanning outdoors you can't just switch off the sun at a precise moment. A tanning bed will turn off automatically at a set time, and the maximum is usually 15-20 minutes, less for a high pressure bed, and can always be set for a less amount than the recommended time if you want. It's unlikely that you would lie outdoors for just 15 minutes at a time and then call it quits. If you tan in moderation it's not as dangerous as people make it out to be.
