I would check out The Weight Loss Cure by Kevin Trudeau.  He suggests that obesity is a result of ingesting preservatives, antibiotics and pesticides in our food and a multi billion dollar diet industry that is invested in keeping people fat and unhealthy so they can sell their products.   Check him out before you beat yourself up.  He's credible.
