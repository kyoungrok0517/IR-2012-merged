My buddy did. It took a good year before I noticed any visible change (he said he noticed growth after about 6 months). All I know is that it was super expensive to do (about $10000). And painful and bleeding the first week. He explained the ritual about the massaging his head and using some laser comb now to sustain the growth. I does look better now (almost a year and a half) and he has much more confidence (and the hair keeps growing all the time)! So that counts as a yes, he had good results.
