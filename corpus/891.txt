Do something simple, and make sure it still tastes good even when cold - the meat fats in Mexican food tend to set up and congeal if they're left to sit at all... :\

Cooked corn cobs slathered with crema, lime juice and chili powder?  That's a super-common street food in the Yucatan.  

Or maybe plain old guacamole with chips?  Guacamole's an ancient Aztec dish, everyone loves it, it's good for halal/vegan/kosher, and keeps well.  

Chocolate drinks made from cocoa are also ancient in origin and were drunk by Aztecs.  Mexican hot chocolate is amaaazing, yum.
