That info is not public record and you have no right to it.  You cannot get info on the status of any ones foreclosure. Once it is completed it will be published and that is all you have any right to.

Until a foreclosure is completed the owner has a chance of saving it.  Nobody can buy it or do anything until the foreclosure is completed.  The foreclosure process can take months.
