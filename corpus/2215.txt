Not all steroids are bad. When the word steroid is mentioned many people think of athletes and abusers of steroids. Little do they think of the people who have chronic asthma and need steroids to keep their airways from closing over. These two steroids are different. The good steroid helps to keep the muscles in the airways open making it easier to breath.

It is such a shame that steroids have been given a bad name when the do have therapeutic uses that save many people's lives every year.
