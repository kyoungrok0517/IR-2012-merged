No one knows the truth but it does seem realistic. Its supposely gonna happen December 21, 2012. In my opinion, I thinks the worlds pretty close to ending. Regarding the Gulf oil spill thats going on right now it seems that the Bible even predicted this natural disaster. The oil spill is coming out of an underground natural made oil well. If you read the Revelation 8:8 through 9 it says "And the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood. And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life, died, and the third part of the ships were destroyed." "Great mountain burning with fire" is regarding the oil rig that caught on fire on the coast and it does look like a burning mountain in the pictures and keep in mind that in the time when the bible was written there was no such thing as an oil rig. "The third part of the sea became blood" is representing the "red" oil that has been spilled and spread throughout the ocean and its gonna spread more and more after time and it will kill all ocean life. And i saved the scary part for last. Revelation 8:10 says"and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters." This seems like it can be predicting 2012, because some say a huge asteroid will destroy planet Earth. Look it up on google and you will find the same thing i just told you.
