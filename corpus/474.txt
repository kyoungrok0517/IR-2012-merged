I remember my 40 yr old cousin making these with her kids, and my dad even got into it. She got the recipe online by googling it, and these are the sites she referred to. I hope they will be of some benefit to you. I am wondering if you might be able to get the cylinders at an aquarium supply store. You might just try a general search on ebay and see what type of suppliers you pull up. Maybe some industries use them and you can get them locally to you. Here's the sites:
