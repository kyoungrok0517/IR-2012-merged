I recently got a ticket for not wearing my helmet while riding my motorcycle (stupid idea I know) but I wasn't aware that I was required to.. but I found out the PA law states that because I only have a permit I have to. So I got the ticket for that.. but.. the cop also gave my one for mot wearing eye protection as a separate fine.. is eye protection and the helmet not the same thing? Is this arguable?
