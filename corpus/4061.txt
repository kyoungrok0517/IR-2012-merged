If you are a DO IT YOUR SELF type you can just build one for a couple of hundred bucks. 

1 Get a 4x8 sheet of 3/4 inch plywood
2 Get enough 2x6 decking slats to go all the way around the plywood, Or what ever is cheapest at the hardware store.
3 Get a bunch of coper tubes or small water pipes and line the inside of the box you just made. 
4 pant the box inside and out with flat black paint pipes and all.
5 get clear plastic sheeting like what is used on a deck roof or green house. and mount it on the front of the box.
6 hook your pool filter pump to it with a valve to adjust the water flow or shut it off if the watter starts to get too hot.
7 Face it at the sun.

Here is a link to a air heater box that I built and used through the winter, The plans for it are in PDF format. You can use it to see how to build the box. Adding the water pipe to it would be a no brainer.
