I believe that God brought 10 plagues upon the Earth because his people did not listen and to show them his power.....he sent 10 plagues, one being the so called "Black Death". I think that's when all the locust fill the sky or when all the flies fill the sky. Not totally sure on which one. I believe that God commanded the plague and then he just let it die out.
