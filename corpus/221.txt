I mean maybe the human race along with everything else that can't breath underwater will die but the world will still be there and so will all the other animal creatures that survive under water will live on and so will the sea and the planet. I mean the only way the world can end is if it gets sucked into a black hole. I mean if an astorid hit it I'm sure plenty of creatures would survive too. I mean just look at the dinsors age. They died but some how we came out of it
