Unions are great for the most part. They gave many Americans
a decent wage and better working conditions.
The problem seems to be that companies in order to make money
for their investors are moving overseas where the labour is cheaper
and they can still make products  to sell in the U.S. at a lesser
price then if it was made here. Apple has 100,000 Chinese working
for them.
