Hi, everyone. Last week, a college student from my community died in a car accident in trying to avoid a deer. I don't know exact details but I think she was driving on an area with 40 mph limit sign and deer warning sign posted. The article said she swerved onto trees as she was trying to avoid hitting a deer.
It was especially tragic because she was such a bright, young woman who was gonna be an asset in this world. I imagined myself in her situation. What choice would I have made? Would I hit the deer straight-on instead of avoiding? Would hitting the deer decrease the chance of dying dramatically?
I realize there is a remote chance anyone will face this situation in their life when driving. But I still would like to hear what is the most appropriate action to take in such situations.
What is the safest way to react when a deer suddenly pops up in front of your car on a 40mph limit road? 
Thanks in advance for any insights.
