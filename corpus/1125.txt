Your two criteria, best athlete and most popular, are completely different. Babe Ruth was certainly one of the most popular athletes of all time. Players are always more famous in their own time, and that Babe Ruth is still as prominent in our culture as he is after 80 years is a huge statement. His superstar demeaner and flashy charisma were as iconic of the 1920's as the Great Gatsby or flappers. Better athletes have come and gone, including many of the players you've mentioned and probably many more, but few if any have symbolized an entire era of American history in the way he did.
