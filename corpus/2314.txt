@ "Jan409", diseases CAN be infectious.  Do you understand what the word "infectious" means?

"Why the diseases caused by smoking are not infectious?"  --  That's simple.  Because the diseases caused by smoking are exactly that  --  caused by smoking.  They're not caused by pathogenic organisms that can be transmitted to others.
