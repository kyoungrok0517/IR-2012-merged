Well the tax to withdraw money from a retirement account is meant as a disincentive to withdraw that money in the first place.  I mean, what's the point of withdrawing money meant to be used for your future retirement?  They do make exceptions where that penalty doesn't apply (1st time housebuying, education, death, & disability).

As for end of year taxes, if you're contributing to a Roth IRA, you're taxed now on what you contribute (the contribution doesn't reduce your taxable income thus your taxes are higher because your taxable income is higher) but when you retire & receive the funds, they are non-taxable.  If contributing to a traditional IRA, you get to claim the tax benefit of it now but when you retire & receive funds, you pay the taxes on it at that point.  The advantage with the Roth is that although you get no tax benefit, you're getting taxed on the contribution but the contribution you make grows over time and is worth more when you retire & its all tax-free.
