I have heard that vitamin E serum really helps to rejuvenate skin that is scarred. I have used it on stretch marks and noticed an improvement.
Additionally, you *could* look into going to your doctor to see what they say about possible treatments. New technology is advancing this field and they may know something that we don't!
Good luck.
