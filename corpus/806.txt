Good observation.  The seed was probably dropped there by a bird.  The seed then germinated and fused to your pecan tree. The fusion occurs because the mistletoe is a parasite and it has made a strong and close connection between itself and the Pecan for the purpose of stealing the food and water of your pecan tree.  The connection is so close that it appears to be attached completely.
