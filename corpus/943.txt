Vancouver, definitely.
However it could depend on if you want to be near where lots of opportunites are being filmed, where all the auditions apparently are, or whether you want to do acting behind a camera or on Broadway/theatre.
I'm not sure whether it's really true or not about Toronto having more auditions. Toronto is more for Broadway and theatre, and Vancouver is more for films, television and commercials. 
It's like New York City and LA. NYC is for Broadway, and LA is where all the film stars go for movies and such.
Hope I could help!
