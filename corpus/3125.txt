BMI works to an extent - you can have a "normal" BMI of 23 or so, but not be healthy due to lack of exercise or a high body fat percentage.  Conversely, many athletes probably have a higher BMI than someone of the same size, because muscle weighs more than fat, and BMI doesn't take that into consideration.  So BMI gives you an idea of where you should be, but it's nowhere near exact.  41 is bad, especially if you are not muscular.
