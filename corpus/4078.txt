Hey everyone, a few questions regarding the topics:

1.How does environment relate to asexual and sexual reproduction?
2.What are the disadvantages and advantages for both asexual and sexual reproduction?
3.What is binary fission?
4.How does mitosis relate to cancer?

Also, is it the nucleus or the nucleolus that is the "control centre" in the cell? I keep getting them confused!

By the way, please be sure to break this stuff down to me as if I were retarded because scientific lingo confuses me sometimes...I'm really not gonna be a scientist, I just wanna pass my bio test (which is tomorrow, so please answer this!) 
THANKS!

P.S. Mr.Cawley, if you're reading this, you own even though I have to go to yahoo answers because I don't understand your explanations! XD
