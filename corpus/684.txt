What is the average length of a full grown standard dachshund? I know their weight is 15-28 lbs, and they highroad is 8-10 inches but what is their length? I can't find it online anywhere! We just bought a baby dachshund pup and wanna know what to look forward to. :)
*height.. not highroad.. lol thanks.
