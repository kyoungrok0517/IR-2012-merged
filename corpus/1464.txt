There were too many reasons. First was the Japanese had no idea where the US carriers were, and didn't want to risk getting caught with all their planes at Pearl when the US carriers attacked. Secondly, the second wave encountered much heavier resistance than the first wave, and correspondingly more casualties. So it was decided that the third wave wasn't worth the losses they might suffer.

Ironically however, this third wave was intended to target the ship repair yard and oil storage. If those facilities had been knocked out, there's a real possibility that the US would have withdrawn from Hawaii to safer harbour on the mainland.
