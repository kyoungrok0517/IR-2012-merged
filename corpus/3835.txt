without being sued for wrongful termination? 

This person is always on time and does a good job at what she does, but she is always in a rotten mood and brings down everyones' mood with her. She is constantly trying to bully the younger employees into doing things for her, (i.e. go to starbucks and get her coffee) and if they don't do it she will spread rumors about them and talk endlessly about them behind their backs, so that others will turn against them. I know it sounds childish, but she acts like a teenage girl even though she is in her 40's, and she knows just how to push everyone's buttons. Most people try to avoid her at all cost, but it's difficult not to get caught in her wrath.

Almost everyone that works here wants the manager to fire her, but the manager doesn't think he can do it without getting a law suit (and believe me, I wouldn't put it past this woman to sue the company for wrongful termination.)
