Tornadoes start when warm, moist air and cool, dry air meet above an area. The warm, moist air is pushed towards the ground while the cool, dry air hangs high in the atmosphere. As the warm, moist air condenses into clouds, it rises and produces an energy known as latent heat from the process of condensation. This latent heat gives more energy to the storm. As the warm, moist air reaches the cool, dry air, the warm air puts extreme pressure on the cool air (cool air is also known as a cap). As the warm air puts more and more pressure on the cap, the cap might finally give away and the warm, moist air and cool, dry air mix. The mixing of these air masses causes instability. This instability causes wind shear. Wind shear is wind moving at different altitudes, speeds, and directions. When these air streams collide, they form a horizontally rotating barrel of air known as a mesocyclone. An updraft lifts this mesocyclone vertical and the whole thunderstorm will begin to rotate. As more warm, moist air is fed into the mesocyclone, the mesocyclone will grow to be 2 - 6 miles in width. By now the thunderstorm is now a super-cell. All the warm, moist air will have to exit the storm somehow as a downdraft, and sometimes it will run down the sides of the mesocyclone towards the ground. This is known as a RFD (rear flank downdraft). The RFD funnels the meocyclone into a smaller and smaller point near the surface of the Earth. This is now a tornado. As a powerful updraft flows into the storm, a low pressure area forms at the surface of the Earth. This low pressure area and the RFD pushing the funnel downward cause the funnel to reach the surface as a tornado.
