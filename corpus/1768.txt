I am a guy, about 30 years old and I am not completely bald but have lost some hair on top of my head.

I am planning to do a hair transplant surgery where they take a strip from the back of my head which contains about 2600 grafts and plant on different places on top of my head.

I have booked the surgery but still a little hesitant.

I want to hear stories of people that have done the surgery and what they think about the results afterwards.
