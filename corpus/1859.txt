I am tracking my paternal grandmother's ancestry and have hit a roadblock.  I'd like to do dna testing to see, but I'm not sure which test would give me the correct results-admixture?  Also, does it matter if it's a female or male descendant who does the test?  Since they're expensive tests, I want to make sure we do it correctly!  Thanks!
