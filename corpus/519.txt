My suggestion to you would be to take another class in home inspections as getting a becoming a home inspector is easier.  It seems most larger appraisal firms are adding home inspection to their business with the current market conditions if you add this you will become a great asset and will even gain pay while your gaining credits toward your license. If you want to gain some experiance with the mls system feel free to let me know I can help you there.
