I undertake a water fast for 5+ days every six months under the supervision of a qualified medical professional. I lose a lot of water weight and about 1 pound of muscle at the start. On average, I lose about 1/2 pound per day of fat weight. Because I eat a whole plant based diet, the fat weight is lost permanently and I regain the muscle and water weight after I stop the fast.

I have lost 90 pounds of fat weigh most of which I attribute to my change to a whole plant based diet. For information about this diet, I suggest any of the following authors:

Dr. Neal Barnard
Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Jr.
Dr. Dean Ornish

You can lose weight easily by changing your food choices. A fast is totally ineffective unless you change food choices before and after the fast. A fast needs to be medically supervised and is not required in your case.
