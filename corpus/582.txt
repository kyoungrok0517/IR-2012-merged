i am so sorry about your friend. it is possible she may have paniced as such an occurance is not an everyday thing.  had she hit the deer, she still may have died if the deer was a large one as there would have been substantial damage. braking hard may have helped but then again it depends on the road conditions.  The situation has many outcomes.
