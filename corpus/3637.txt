Rule of thumb is 75%.  Unless she has a valid lease, use the same rent that the 2 units bring in.  Add the 3, take 75% & see if it is negative or positive in relation to the payment.  If negative it will be counted against her as a debt.  Don't be surprised if they as for tax returns to look at the real estate schedule.
