they have recalls because the general public usually brings it to there attention that there are major flaws in there product,,sometimes they recall them without the public help,,but in most cases the public plays a big roll in helping get this done,,and it helps save lives,,if they didn't have the, recalls there would be a  lot of junk out there on the roads,,good luck,,i hope this help,s.
