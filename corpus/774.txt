I bought a touch lamp that requires an incandescent bulb.  I love the lamp but the way it is shaped, it looks funny with a standard size bulb.  So I'm using a ceiling fan bulb, but the brightest I can find is 60 watts.  Are there any small (short) incandescent light bulbs that use a medium base that are brighter than a 60 watt bulb?  ceiling fan, appliance or otherwise--I just need it to be short.
