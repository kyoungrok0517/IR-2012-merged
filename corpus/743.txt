Yes. The only real difference between them  (besides the energy saving characteristics and longevity) is that the fluorescent may not be dimmed normally. That is, do not put a fl. bulb into a lamp that is on an incandescent dimmer. Fluorescent require special (expensive) dimmers. This also applies to outdoor fixtures (designed for incandescents) that have a dimming feature that cuts in after a set time in the evening (for softer light when less likely;y to be needed).
