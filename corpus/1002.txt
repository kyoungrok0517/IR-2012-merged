Without an idea of departure point, where you want to go, when you want to go and for length of time, this question really cannot be answered.  Cruises range greatly in price between, for example, Alaska, versus the Carribean.

Just one example:  For a 13 day alaskan cruise tour, the fare for 2 people can vary between $4400 and $17000 depending on time of year and type of cabin selected.
