Yes sir I know the reason. Please think of Tug of war game. The people are pulling the rope from both the sides.But when one side fail to pull the other side person will fall. The same way the tectonic plates are made out of rocks that is also a type of metal that expands due to heat. And contracts when it is cooled down. The tectonic plates are under heavy stress before it erupt and generate earthquakes.The early morning the temperature becomes low and the tectonic plates gives  way to slip. Therefore most of the earthquakes are taking place in the early morning. I want to tell you another fact also about earthquakes. The new moon and full moon days are more vulnerable days for earthquakes because there is a force already acting under tectonic plates that tries to come out.The new moon and full moon days are disturbing the gravitational force that helps and give a new pull up force from out side of earth.When the pushing force from inside earth and pull up force acting on top of earth helps to accelerate the process of earthquakes.
