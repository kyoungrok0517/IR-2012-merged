Everybody says moon phase mess wiht daily deer travel.  I realize it's easier for a deer to see in a full moon but deer are pretty much nocturnal anyways so why does it make a difference.  I get more trail cam pictures at night no matter what the moon phase is, but there never seems to be a change in deer movement if the moon phase is different.
