I would like to include this in a report I am writing about the Mexico City 1985 Earthquake, but I've been having a tough time finding this just by using google, so I thought I'd give YA a try!

P.S. If you just so happened to know a range of the magnitudes of those earthquakes, that would be awesome too!

Thanks a bunch!
