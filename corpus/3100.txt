C)  The water level in the oceans wouldn't change unless it rained 

It's kind of a devious question, since you don't really know where they're coming from.  They might be trying to say that the water required would evaporate from the ocean, or they might be saying that more water in the atmosphere would cause more rain.  I'd go with C), since you can argue it if they mark it wrong.
