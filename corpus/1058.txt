I am looking to travel to both Washington DC for a night then to Baltimore Maryland. I was planning on flying and not renting a car, so I was wondering what the best way to get from Washinton DC to downtown Baltimore was on a weekend. I notice MARC does not operate on the weekends. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
