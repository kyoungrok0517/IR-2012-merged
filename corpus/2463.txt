Antonio Meucci was the true inventor of the telephone. He had a caveat on the invention, but couldn't afford the $10 to maintain it. In fact, congress recognized these FACTS in 2002 by saying:

"If Meucci had been able to pay the $10 fee to maintain the caveat after 1874, no patent could have been issued to Bell."

The resolution's sponsor described it as "a message that rings loud and clear recognizing the true inventor of the telephone, Antonio Meucci".

ADD:

Actually, Fred, you're a decade off. Bell first started experimenting in 1873. And he didn't have success until 1876, in Ontario. So you failed to answer the original question correctly.

As for Meucci (to those who gave me thumbs down!) if you don't believe me, then you should read more about what actually happened. Here's a good link that provides a basic summary of it:

Learn the facts, and then make a judgement.

ADD:

It's not rewriting history! It's showing what REALLY happened! They're simply recognizing the FACTS! Accepting one story as the truth without learning the whole story, is rewriting history.

Silly Canadians, trying to cover up the truth so they can say the telephone was invented in their country!

ADD:

No, it has nothing to do with that!! Meucci was Italian and did a large portion of his experimenting in Italy. Anyone who knows me knows I am definitely not the "all-American" type. I could care less about trying to attribute an invention to America.

And it has nothing to do with what CONGRESS said, it's just nice congress finally recognized something MANY OF US have known for years. 

Now I won't deny that Bell invented the telephone, in his own right. I'm not even saying he stole the idea from Meucci. BUT, Meucci DID invent it FIRST. If you read about it, you can see there were a number of reasons why he isn't credited, but the bottom line is, he got screwed.
