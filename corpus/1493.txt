Answerers please note this question is about Whales, NOT general animal rights, kangaroos or PETA.
Whales are endangered mammals and should therefore be protected, no exceptions.
The only thing the Japanese are researching is how the whales taste. It sickens me. In some cases it takes up to 90 minutes for a whale to die by harpooning.
