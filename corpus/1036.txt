If money is really not an issue and you like an urban environment, try Fell's Point or the harbor area.  Do you have kids?  There are some excellent private schools.  Otherwise, you may want to choose a suburb with highly rated schools. The suburbs in Northern Baltimore County are beautiful.  Again, very expensive.
