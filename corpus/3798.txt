Well, you have examples of the basic stuff...albeit in hi-tech form...like: thermometers, hygrometers, barometers, psychrometers, anemometers. Some of this is on the ground, some launched aloft on pilot balloons (rawinsondes) or even on commercial and military aircraft.

Then you have examples of the remote sensing stuff like: satellites with cameras & radiometers, Doppler radar, wind profilers (RASS, Sodar, Lidar, etc), and celiometers. I often hear some of my colleagues refer to rawinsondes and aircraft-board instruments as remote sensing instrumentation...and I don't argue.

If you can consider computers as weather instruments, then so be it. I personally don't...the hardware, the diagnostic programs they run to assimilate and format data, and the prognostic modeling they perform  I consider "tools", not instruments (data has already been collected by instruments). Just the opinion of an old-school meteorologist...
