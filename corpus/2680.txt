First of all your friend needs to do that pregnancy test, she could be worrying about nothing. 

 Secondly, if she is pregnant she has to face up to her actions, and make a big decision on how this is going to affect her life, and the life of the foetus - if there's to be one.  I think she's should thank her lucky stars that she has you as her friend, as you've been doing your best to help her in every avenue of this situation.  She has to take the first step though, by finding out if there is going to be any changes.  Pregnancy tests now can tell you if your pregnant or not, on the day your period is due.  

Thirdly, if she is pregnant, then I would encourage her to speak to her family about this.  Yes, she did a stupid thing by sleeping with this guy at the party, without using protection (I guess).  Hopefully, she'll be more carefully.  

Fourthly, you can only do so much for her.  She's the one that has to make this choices, as it's her life and a possible babies life to consider.
