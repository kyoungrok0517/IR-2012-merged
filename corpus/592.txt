Very sad that a promising young person is gone. How unfortunate that she steered so sharply she went off the road.  Trees are VERY STURDY. They are unforgiving when struck by a car. Don't do it.
My answer to deer encounters is, 
Hit the brakes hard, press the horn. 
Deer seem unable to compensate for the speed and direction of an auto. But try to chase one down on foot and they leave you in the dust. I have found that the horn will usually spook them away from you. Especially at night, they try to run where the headlights are shining because they can see better there, but that puts them directly in front of your car.
HIT THE BRAKES, HIT THE HORN AND DO NOT SWERVE MORE THAN JUST A LITTLE BIT. 

That is a maneuver one has to practice for or it is too easy to oversteer and crash.
