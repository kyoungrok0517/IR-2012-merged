her parents will still love her. No matter if they agree, disagree, or are really upset. Good parents are unconditionally loving. Everyone makes mistakes and you learn from them. SHE NEEDS TO TELL THEM!
 If she is pregnant and is planning on keeping the baby, she needs to be financially stable as well as emotionally. It sucks that she got herself into this, but she can't punish the child for her mistakes. If she can't take care of the baby, then the right thing to do would be to adopt him or her out. 
For right now, it's great that you are there for her. It must be very hard for you to deal with this at your age. Kudos to your maturity.
She needs to do some serious praying to God. She needs to know that He is with her and He will love her always. God Bless you.

It may also help her to talk to another woman. She should call some of the hotlines you've called. Does she have a sister or a cousin, or a best girl friend?
