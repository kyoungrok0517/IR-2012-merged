Eh.

I don't know all them off my top of my head, but I know 1, 2 & 3..
1. The environment must NOT change in order for an asexual organism to survive.
2. Asexual - no need to find a mate, no need for males, but no DIVERSITY
Sexual - need to find a mate, need to have males in the earth, provides diversity, which is evolution.

3. binary fission is basically cells splitting, and the parent cell passing on it's exact genes to the new ones.
