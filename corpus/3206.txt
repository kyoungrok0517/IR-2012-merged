Well, just based on my own memory...

The Khmer Rouge basically gained momentum in the early 1970s when the Kingdom of Cambodia was overthrow in a military coup (backed by the U.S.) in 1970...by 1975, the Khmer Rouge had gained so much anti-govt. and anti-Am. support that they overthrew the presiding govt. and installed a Communist govt.  When they did this, their leader Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge used social engineering to destroy all Western or perceived Western influence in the country, evacuating the cities and forcing everyone to live in a true classless, commune-oriented society.  In the process, they ended up kill via executions, imprisonment, or starvation, anywhere from 1 to 2 million Cambodians.  So in the span of less than 10-15 years, they went from a stable country to mass chaos!

As another side note, the Khmer Rouge and the Communist Vietnamese govts. hated each other (for reasons I'm not entirely sure about).  So Pol Pot attacked Vietnam in a pre-emptive strike in 1978, but it completely failed and the Vietnamese govt. retaliated in response.  After many years of war, the Khmer Rouge were forced out of power.  Now a lot of the leaders (including Pol Pot) have been tried or are currently on trial for crimes against humanity.  That bastard Pol Pot died JUST BEFORE he was to turn himself in to a intl. tribunal, so justice was never served there.

All of this mess is directly related to our war in Vietnam, because Cambodia tried to be neutral, but the Viet Cong kept using their side of the border as a safe haven...we didn't like that, so we helped put in a pro-Am. govt. that allowed us to do things like bomb the crap out their own country.  So once again, you can blame this all on American foreign policy hubris.

Hope this helps, enjoy.
