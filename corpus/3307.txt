Private and parochial schools require school uniforms.  Uniforms eliminate gang related colors and dress styles, click behavior and chat regarding who is wearing what.

The uniform is also a great equalizer.

As a parent it certainly cuts the amount in the budget for school clothes  and the tears and tantrums over what to wear.

Builds school pride as students are easily recognized as attendees of that school.

I read a newspaper article about student reaction in a low income school district to school uniforms:  They were very pleased, felt it made school attendance serious and professional.

Good luck!
