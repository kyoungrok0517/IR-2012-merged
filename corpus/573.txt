This is a biology question. I know that if there are less deer, the wolf (predators) population would  drop too, and if there are more wolves the deer population would drop. But how could a rise in deer population cause the wolves to rise? Please don't just say that there are more deer for the wolves to eat because that doesn't really make the population rise
