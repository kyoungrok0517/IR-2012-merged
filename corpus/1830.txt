I would say $30.00 learning the physics of pool takes a long time and the stick doesn't dictate the physics too much at all. But be careful "YOU CAN'T BRAEK WITH A TWO PIECE STICK, IT WILL WARP WHICH IS BAD". I play with a solid stick because I am wood guy but I have played with some really nice metals as well. don't worry about price it is all about feel. A cue isn't an extension of my body, I feel like it is a natural part of my body. Good Luck.
