Use a fluorescent light (preferably a full-spectrum tube).  Incandescent bulbs use a lot more electricity.  The main difference is how they produce light.  The incandescent bulb produces light by heating a filament so much that it glows.  A fluorescent tube produces light by heating mercury;  the resulting vapor excites phosphorus atoms which ultimately produce visible light.
