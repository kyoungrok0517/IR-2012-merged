Ican tell you that you don't want to be a nurse. I am currently a nurse, and the shortage is horrible. We get very little respect. Patients and family member have threaten to suite nurses and hospital because of the lack of care. I am LPN and I was going for my BSN, but I have changed to Respiratory therapist.
