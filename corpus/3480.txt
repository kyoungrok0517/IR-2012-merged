Many doctors and other medical and nutrition experts recommend not giving babies honey until they are a year old. Honey can contain Clostridium botulinum spores, which can cause severe illness in infants.

Botulism attacks the nervous system and causes double vision, droopy eyelids, and difficulty in swallowing and breathing. It also can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Symptoms of infant botulism include lethargy, weakness, loss of head control, and a wail or altered cry. Symptoms typically develop within 18 to 36 hours and can last weeks to months. The severity can range from mild illness to severe paralysis and sudden death, if not treated. Even with treatment, it can cause nerve damage.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and UAB physicians emphasize that if your child has unusual gastrointestinal symptoms, and there is any chance he might have eaten contaminated or poisonous foods, immediately call your pediatrician or poison control center.

According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, the number of confirmed infant botulism cases has increased significantly as a result of greater awareness of the problem by health officials, since its recognition in 1976. It is now internationally recognized, with cases being reported in more countries. UAB dietitians stress, however, that honey is safe for older children.
