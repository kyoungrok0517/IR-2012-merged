I am going to be moving into an apartment and was wondering if wiener dogs are good pets to have. I know somebody who has one and she is very sweet and loyal and a good snuggler. However I will be gone for work hours (9-5) and was wondering if this may be too long for a dog to be alone. I will take him out to play and run and get exercise but don't want to confine him too much. Also, any tips on dog ownership and training in an apartment would be welcomed.
