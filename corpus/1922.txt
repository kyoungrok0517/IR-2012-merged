No, the vikings did not found Scotland; the Scotti did.  The Scotti are thought by some historians to have been an 'offshoot' of the Dalriadic migrational group which came to (what is now) Scotland from Ireland sometime around roughtly 400 or 500 CE (AD).  The Scottish relation to Irish roots can be noted in cultural similarities like: the mutual use of bagpipes, similar clothing types, related languages, etc.
