On the one side, the agreement between Bill and the hotel is that he gets a room for the given day.  Nothing in their agreement stipulates that the room is explicitly for the parade.

On the other side, Bill got the room specifically for the parade, and since that's been canceled, so should his room contract.

He'd lose in a court setting, but the hotel could do him a courtesy by refunding his payment, if only to build good will between the two.
