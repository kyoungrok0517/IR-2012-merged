Honey sometimes contains botulism spores. Botulism is a very serious, often fatal disease.
While older children and adults are able to deal with the spores in honey, infants cannot, and can end up seriously ill.

(Botulism from honey is very rare, but since it IS so serious, and there is no reason a baby needs to eat honey, it's best to avoid even the small risk by avoiding honey.)
