Sadly, no. It is most accurate for someone who has more muscle than normal(lazy) people but less than an athlete(for you that may be 104). Sense BMI is general, it can't go into specifics. Therefore, if you really want to know, go to the doctor or your workout place(24 hour fitness, etc..) and ask if they have the fat calculate(don't know the specific name). It also is not exact but gives you a better idea of how much your muscle vs. fat weighs. Otherwise, just know that your BMI is inaccurate. This is exactly why BMI is mostly for people not in shape and just starting to learn about how to eat healthy and excises. They are just being taught not to worry about weight but mass.
