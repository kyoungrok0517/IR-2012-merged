My male ferret (age 5) is experiencing difficulty in using his hind legs - The left more than the right.  The vet told me it could be a sign or advance adrenal disease or lymphoma.  His lymph nodes and spleen do not seem to be swollen, so lymphoma is probably not the case.  However, difficulty using the hind legs seems to be one of the last symptoms of adrenal disease - The first and most prominent symptom being hair loss.  My ferrets has not experienced any hair loss.  He did lose some weight and was quite a bit larger when he was a young (1-2 years old) ferret, but all my ferrets seem to have gotten slightly smaller as they advance in age.  He did not seem to display excessive drinking and urinating, or increased scratching.  And the hind-leg weakness seems to have come on rather suddenly.  Does anyone have any additional information for me?
