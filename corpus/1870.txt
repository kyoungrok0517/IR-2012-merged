It depends on where you go.  The only experience I've had with DNA testing is with my pony- it cost $30, along with shipping and handling, sending the hair samples to Kentucky.
I suggest searching the internet, or even contacting the breed registry for information.
Good luck, and congratulations on your new dog!
