The white tail deer loves to eat oats mixed with molasses. This will keep them coming for a long time. You can by this at any Agway or Blue seal outlet. Purple clove, apple tree's, small gardens with standing corn, and some juniper bushes, ceder trees for the bark is nutrition, blueberry bushes, raspberry bushes, tee berry's, perennial flowers, salt licks, or plant biologic. As long as there is water near by, shelter, and plenty of food, they will keep on coming. 
Make sure that if you start feeding them out of a trough to bleach it out 2Ce a year so that no deceases are spread like mad cow disease. This is contracted by too many animals by saliva. Lime disease is contracted by the deer tick. Raccoons will be around so rabies will most likely be seen once a year. 
The only problem that will arise is that the deer will be DEPENDANT on YOU to feed them. Here in Maine, the winters are brutal so we only feed them when they are most hungry to help keep them fat and healthy. Make sure you do not feed them during the specified months controlled by your local IF&W.
