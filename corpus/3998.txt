Just a note, these are species.
And your answer depends on how specific you are being. For example, Oxen are really just a type of cattle. If you were to admit this as a separate breed/species, you could also include the Zebu and Banteng. The reindeer is also domesticated, some populations of fallow deer are domesticated.
