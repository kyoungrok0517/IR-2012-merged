A concept I recommend researching is "papanca". Here is a lecture on it. I also recommend the other lectures on this site.

I find that the papanca model has much in common Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and you can find out about that through your doctor. CBT has exercises that lead to insight and improved self-control. People with biologic depression are often able to reduce or eliminate their medication with CBT. I personally think Buddhists have a great advantage with it.

I recommend Metta meditation, which also has much in common with CBT.

Vipassana meditation is very beneficial and I recommend seeking instruction at a temple or meditation center.

Ringu Tulku's book Daring Steps Towards Fearlessness discusses tantric meditation and is a very enjoyable read.

The Katbat-Zinn thing sounds like a guided meditation, which poses its own challenges that may not be appropriate for you. Zazen (Zen) is an excellent practice which is solo. A good book on this is Harcore Zen by Brad Warner.

Biologic depression inspires non-biologic depression. Meditation and Buddhist practice can certainly resolve non-biologic depression, but in my experience it can not cure biologic depression. However, eliminating one component of your depression may make the rest manageable. While biologic depression may persist, meditation can eliminate the suffering. For instance, meditation will not cure a toothache, but one can feel pain and not suffer from it if one merely observes the pain. Likewise, one can just observe their depression without getting caught up in it.
