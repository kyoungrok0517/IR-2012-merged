Hello John

A face to face one can last from 20 mins to hour, hour half, depends on the work being done. 

You will find that with a CD that it, as with all hypnosis, will be a series of relaxation stages & even in face to face therapy clients can drift off. 

As long as your not doing anything that requires your attention you will be fine.
