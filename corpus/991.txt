Like in:
Bruce Almighty - Jim Carrey
The Good Girl - Jake Gyllenhaal
Along Came Polly - Ben Stiller
The Break-Up - Vince Vaughn
Marley & Me - Owen Wilson
Love Happens - Aaron Eckhart

Granted, Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't really fit into the great actors up there, but he is widely famous.  Jennifer Aniston is always playing the same exact role!  She always plays an innocent girl that gets together or is together with the other character that the famous actor plays.

Thank you!
