Well dobbler radar is used to view storms and rain in the area via sound impulses. Weather stations which you can buy for your home, make forecasts and give information like wind speed (anemometer), direction (wind vane), temperature (thermometer), humidity (hygrometer), barometric pressure (barometer), rainfall (rain gauge), and sometimes UV and solar (pyranometer). Most home weather stations are wireless. But some are cabled. Some can communicate to the home computer. This maybe more reliable than the local weather station which maybe as much as 30 miles away. It may rain their but not at your place. Or vis versa. Weather can very every 100 yrds. So an acurate weather forcast can be done at your house.
