if you can, buy a Saab, they design their car to have a stronger A pillar because in sweden hitting  deer was a common accident and driving in the snow make it easier to hit deer.

if you cannot then , try breaking hard but not locking the wheels (if there is no ABS in your car) and start pray that the deer didnt go to your wind screen (if you dont drive saab) coz it could go straight to you and you end up kissing the deer in the mouth.

what ever happend dont swerved into a tree coz if you survive, you end up trying to convince other that there are a deer in the street at that time and it is more hurtful if other (e.g. police) thinking in their mind "yeah right!! at this hours!"
and hitting the deer is totally different than hitting the tree, deer will give ways and tree don't, even if it is they probbably end up in your roof anyway and crushing you below. oh when you about to hit the deer even after you break your best, duck coz the next place the deer would likely visit is your wind screen!!

i am sorry about your friend.
