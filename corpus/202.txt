Better ask the crackpots because they can't seem to agree. Some say a 'galactic alignment'. Some say a solar flare. Some say a mystery planet (so far, invisible) will pass by and cause the Earth's poles to flip (the solar flare is also going to do that). Then there is a planetary alignment or a 'photon belt' and the list goes on....
You notice the difference between this load of claptrap and real astronomical predictions? When (for example) an eclipse is predicted, you don't get some astronomers saying it will be a total eclipse, some saying a partial eclipse and others saying there will be no eclipse at all. They all agree exactly on what will happen. This alone should tell you that the 2012 nonsense is all made up by a bunch of cranks.
