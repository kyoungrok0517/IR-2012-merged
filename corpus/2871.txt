Some reasons are:
Blue staters are more educated people who eat healthier foods, exercise more and visit their doctors more.  
Blue staters care more about their physical appearance - they wear trendier clothing which require a slimmer figure.
Additionally city dwellers walk more, party more.  Partying/dancing is a form of cardio exercise as well as endorphin producers.

Red staters are less educated than red staters.  They drive more, eat more, eat more UNHEALTHY foods. They are the most obese people, not only in the USA, but in the world. 

Their recreational pastimes  are primarily stationary,  such as watching TV, fishing or sitting on the deck rocking and sunning.
They used workout more while tending to the farms, but farm work has gone hi-tech.  Blue states are slowly becoming quasi-suburban so they taken to resting up too much.
