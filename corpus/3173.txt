When he was 16, he enrolled in the Hampton Institute in Virginia. After graduation Washington became a teacher in Tinkersville, West Virginia for three years. In 1878 he left to attend Wayland Seminary in Washington DC, but quit after six months. In 1879 Armstrong asked him to return to Hampton Institute as a teacher. Washington did so, and then in 1881 Armstrong recommended him as the principal of a new school called Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama...
As Washington's influence with whites and blacks grew he reaped several honors. In 1901 he wrote a bestseller called Up From Slavery - his autobiography. He also became an advisor to the President of the United States - Theodore Roosevelt. He became the first black ever to dine at the White House with the President."
