One is from the LORD Allah SWT his light his seeds

The other is a seal from Allah SWT for your transgression against your very soul and that is depression from the Jinn or shytan allowing you to let your heart and your chest be whispered into.. chapter 113 114 The Holy Quran or the Quran Translation in whatever language you choose inshAllah tahala the Arabic is the word of Allah SWT the translation is the meaning of the words of Allah SWT in that langauge nouns and verbs don't fall together in the arabic text that is why it was brought that way check the structure its Subhanallah!

one is God all goodness and one is devil all his suggestions you allow.. so if you getting that you are not doing something correctly and not guided.

Salam
He who is Guided by Allah SWT is and forever remains in that guidance and he who has not has surely fallen by a existing suggestor that is disturbing their peace and patience
