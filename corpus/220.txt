Well, rapture is failed and Harold Camping is wrong about that. But I'm very sorry for him (Harold Camping) it's like what do he feel now that he is wrong? And it's written in the bible, that no one ever knew when the end was even the angels doesn't know when will it happen.. BUT, I feel like it's gonna be soon, because of the natural calamities, wars, and many, many more... And these are just the beginning of it.
