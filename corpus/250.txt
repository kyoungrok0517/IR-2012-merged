The current body style came out in 2007.  As of right now there are no confirmed plans for a make over, but GM usually changes every 7 years on their trucks and SUV's.  Going off of that trend, you could expect a new body style in 2014 or 2015.  I would not let that stop me from buying one now.  They are great trucks.
