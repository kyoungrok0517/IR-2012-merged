Yeah that's a bit low, a healthy bmi would be around 20, give or take a point or two. You might want to try a high carb diet with a lot of protein. Also, you might want to try to drink one protien shake a day in addition to your current meals. Whatever you do DO NOT eat fatty, greasy foods to gain weight, this can lead to diabetis or heart disease later in life.
