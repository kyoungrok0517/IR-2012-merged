King Håkon IV of Norway lived from 1204 to 16 December 1263. He is also referred to as Haakon or Haco. The Norwegian Account of Haco's Expedition Against Scotland, 1263 is a classic account of Håkon or Haco's campaign against Alexander III of Scotland in 1263, a campaign that culminated in the Battle of Largs and resulted in Håkon's death.

From June to August each year Largs pier is a regular calling point for the Waverley, the world's last sea-going paddle steamer, as it carries trippers around and across the Firth of Clyde.
