According to Rashi the "Mixed Multitude" or the Gentiles who practiced sorcery that Moses took pity on and took with them out of Egypt are to blame. The Golden Calf was their god, which they conspired to usurp Moses and the God of Israel.  Aaron and Moses got wind of their plot, and announced a feast. Little did they know the feast was to consist of the golden calf ground up to a dust and put into water. The wicked ones were made to drink the water. Their bodies became swollen in the night, and they all died. End of idolatry problem.
