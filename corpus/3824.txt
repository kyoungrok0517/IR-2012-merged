Sheeze  Phil , settle down will ya Sonny Jim !

One thing a Labor government will not do is make lazy yobbos work because usually lazy yobbos are generational unemployed who all vote Labor because they consider themselves government employees ! Ironical huh ? Their " employee " conditions are better than many genuinely employed people...

Now as for Tony , okay so  he gets a little enthusiastic about his role as OPPOSITION leader but at the end of the day that's his role , to OPPOSE ! I realise that they haven't quite caught up yet but it's actually the government's role to GOVERN !
