u dont need to be married to be happy
many people r completely happy not even dating
personally i dont get why people feel such pressure to get married
thank god im swedish, its not the same here as in the us
and i dont think jen should "settle down"
she seems like a wonderful person,
she deserves someone who truly loves her and she loves back
i dont think she just hook up with the next best guy u know?
she should keep living her life however she wants it
and if there is a guy (or possibly girl) out there for her it will happen eventually
u cant just decide to fall in love
obviously she hasnt met someone she wants to marry, its that simple
or maybe they dumped her who knows?
anyways it doesnt matter shes awesome :)
