Your state housing finance agency may have the best programs available for you if you can work within there restrictions with regard to purchase price and income.

I think your bank may be the best source for you, but of course you can call around and get some quotes on FHA loans as they should be fairly easy to come by. Understand that there is an upfront fee of 1.5% that is paid to the FHA regardless of who you use. That fee can be financed.

Our base costs for an FHA loan are $1,400 plus title insurance and recording fees.

Our HFA program has a standard rate of 6.25% on a 30 year, but requires a 1% origination fee and there is really no rate competition. 

For regular FHA loans, we could either charge an origination fee to offer a lower rate or not charge one at a slightly higher rate. For example, we could offer 6.75% with 0 points or 6.50% with 1% origination. These fees can vary according to loan size with management approval.

Of course, the FHA will allow the seller to pay closing costs and even provide down payment assistance if you need it (at least for the time being so you may want to move quickly if you need that kind of assistance as it may be going away as of 10/1/2008 as a result of HR3221) no matter who you choose to use. Just be sure that your Realtor understands what they need to ask for once you have your pre-approval worked out.

The bottom line is that you want to work with someone who is going to offer the best rate/cost combination. Then you want to be sure that they do what they said they would do and that they will ensure that you get to closing on time.

I hope something I have said will help you with your decision and I wish you the best of luck and happy house hunting.
