In addition to a poor design, the weak rivets mentioned by others, the speed they were traveling, and other reasons already mentioned, Popular Science had an article a few years ago which suggested that the sulfer content of the steel was higher than normal, making it more brittle.  That brittleness caused the side of the ship to rip in a more severe way, whereas it would have had more "give" had the steel been of higher quality, and the resulting gash much smaller.  Higher quality steel, the article said, might have made it possible to reach New York.
