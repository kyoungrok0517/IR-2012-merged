We use surface instruments to measure temperatures (thermometers) , wind speed and direction (anemometers and vanes), amount of moisture in the air (hygrometers), and barometers to measure atmospheric pressure.  We can also put these instruments, except anemometers and vanes, onto weather balloons to get measurements up through the lower atmosphere.  Weather satellites and radar are also used.
