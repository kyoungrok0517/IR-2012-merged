In general terms - ANY pan you use on top of the stove you may use in the oven. Provided as you wish to do and remove the handle. It is not a good idea to leave the handle on and wrap it in foil as some do. It can be done under most circumstances but there are a few exceptions and rather than try to remember them it is just safer to remove the handle.
Sometime when you are shopping pick up a cast iron skillet and season it well. Very non stick and ccompletelyoven proof. Cheap and will last through your great great grandchildren. They just get better with age.
Sometimes you can find an old rusty one at a garage sale cheap. Wash it, rinse and season it.
