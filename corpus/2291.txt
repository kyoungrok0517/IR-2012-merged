Well, lets think for a moment.  Over 200 poisons going into your body.  You can lung cancer, it will be hard to run because you run out of breath.  It costs tons of money because you are addicted, smokes are expensive.  It can add up to another house in 20 years.  Anyone who starts MUST stop unless they want to kill themselves early.  If you start you will also lose most of your friends and not be able to marry anyone.
