Well ... You've already had lots of good advice and the offer of free audio products, so you and your friend may be sorted. That being the case, I hope you won't mind me throwing a spanner in the works.

I think you're asking the wrong question. 

You see, your friend's anxiety is a symptom. Something else is the cause. And if you are going to treat her, surely you want to treat the cause rather than the symptom.

So I think you need to go back to your friend and find out (if you don't know already) what is is about a piece of minor, routine surgery that's making her agitated. Maybe she doesn't like needles. Maybe she doesn't like hospitals. Maybe she doesn't like her skin being opened. And maybe whatever it is is because of a previous experience, or maybe it's because of something she heard from someone else.

I don't think you should try to treat your friend without taking a case history. I know you mean well but she isn't a guinea pig for you to cut your hypno/psycho teeth on. So find out what's driving the anxiety, and then come back and ask again.

Best wishes
