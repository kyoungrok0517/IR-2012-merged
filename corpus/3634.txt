I live in New York and am trying to buy a house.  The appraisal addendum states that the well/septic appear to be within the required HUD/FHA distance guidelines.  The leech field had been repaired and the County has inspected and signed off on the well and septic.  Is it normal for a lender to insist upon a survey showing septic and well distances to each other? Is this a lender discretionary thing? Or an absolute requirement by FHA that this survey show this?
