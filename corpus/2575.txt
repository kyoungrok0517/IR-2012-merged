I guess when they looked out their window and saw an ice berg starring them straight in the face..  any noises etc would of been downplayed by the crew to avoid a panic.

that might be the reason why people were reluctant to take any physical signs of abandoning ship (get life boats out etc) seriously.

RRRR
