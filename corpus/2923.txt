It's okay as long as you like to shop and be a souless corporate dweebo.

 It's nice and all but I odn't fancy being arested for no reason not told any reason for my arrest.
 Taken to a place to be tortured or killed with out ever knowing why.
 Thats borthers me, and the fact that we are fast becoming a theocracy.
 Bothers me too. 

Other than that it's not half bad here.
