Steroids have a real medical benefit, and when prescribed by a doctor can save lives.

Taken without illness, just to build muscle, and it's a drug as bad as heroine and cocaine.  It tears your insides apart, destroys your liver, your immune system, you whole body is ripped apart.  People who take it have no self esteem and care more about looking huge than shaving decades off their life (and adding decades more in pain and misery).

Point is this - let your husband go on steroids and you'll kill him, but not before bringing you both incredible pain.  Plus his temper and blood pressure will skyrocket, causing him to go into rage at the slightest thing; and his testicles will shrivel.

Look it up.  It's true.  Disgusting horrible stuff outside the hands of doctors.
