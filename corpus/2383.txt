yet they indicate a living and dynamic planet. How does plate tectonics help us predict where and when earthquakes will occur?  Can we limit the devastation of earthquakes and volcanoes by knowing more about plate tectonics? Why does a seismic knowledge of the interior of the Earth help us on the surface? Should we initiate planning to avoid catastrophe-prone areas, or should we try to protect against those catastrophes as they occur?
