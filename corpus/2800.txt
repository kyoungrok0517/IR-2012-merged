If you are referring to the plaques that occurred in Europe in the fourteenth century, the most likely reason for the plaque epidemic stopping was the lack of new, susceptible individuals for the fleas that carried the bacteria (Yersinia pestis) to bite.  The aristocracy all moved to their country estates and avoided most of the plaque, while the poor of the cities remained behind and died en masse.  In order for the epidemic to be maintained, there needs to be a sufficient number of susceptible individuals living close enough together.  The plaque killed over 30% of the population, reducing the number of people left who could get and effectively transmit the disease.
