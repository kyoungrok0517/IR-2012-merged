Take him to the vet and make sure that it's actually asthma.  The vet can give you medication and an emergency inhaler.  

The other possibility is that it's actually a "reverse sneeze".  It's something common in smaller dogs and isn't a big concern.  Look it up on youtube, you will know when you see it if that's what is happening to your dog.
