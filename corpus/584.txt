A deer is not worth a human life.  Try to stop, but be willing to take out the deer if necessary.  My wife complains to me about driving down the middle of certain roads in this area.  But there are cornfields coming to the edge of the roads and I want the extra warning if one steps out. and don't want it to be right in front of me.
