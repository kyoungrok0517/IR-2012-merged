The object is not to work hard, but to work smart - smarter than other agents.

You have to decide what area you want to excel in - geographically AND vocationally.

If you decide to specialize in residential real estate, thou must get up to speed with the programs and financing available to first-time buyers, transferees, those folks down-sizing from a larger home to an apartment or smaller home, etc.

Ditto for industrial & commercial - only there aren't any first time buyer program for that aspect. You have to discover what incentives are available for wannabe shop owners and "Captains of Industry".

It might pay for you to join the local Chamber of Commerce.

You should join the local Board of Realtors - if your sponsor is a Realtor.

You should join an investment group AND BE ACTIVE!! Get to be known as a "can-do" type of person. As someone who knows his/her product and the services offered.

You could get into multi-family sales and management. This is very challenging AND it provides a monthly income to help with your expenses.

The opportuites are virtually limited only by the restrictions you place on yourself.

Whichever direction you pursue, you should DO your best to be THE best.

"Warm canvassing" is A LOT easier than cold canvassing.

Have your business cards professionally designed and printed.

You get one opportunity to make a great first impression! Don't louse it up.

The info I provided is only the beginning. There is A LOT MORE to learn.

Thanks for asking your Q! I enjoyed answering it!
