I will be moving to Baltimore at the beginning of August to start graduate school, and I need to find an apartment. I have always been advised to live in the county as opposed to the city. 

Havin said that, I'm giving myself a limit of about $700/month for a one-bedroom (or maybe a studio). What would be the best suburb in Baltimore County for me to start my apartment hunt?
