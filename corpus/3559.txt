I have very pale skin, and I'd like to be a little tan for the spring and summer and shorts-skirts-bikini weather.

How safe are tanning beds and natural tanning, and what should you do to make it any safer?

And what is a good time to spend tanning to just get a light natural tan (in beds and outside)?

Thank you!
