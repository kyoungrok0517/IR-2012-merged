>>>Yes, it's safe as long as the honey is pasteurized.<<<

The risk with eating honey is really a theoretical risk for exposure to botulism, a form of food poisoning caused by the Clostridium botulinum bacteria. In young children (under age 2) we discourage eating honey because their intestines aren’t mature enough to break down and destroy the bacteria. Adults really shouldn't have any increased risk of infection by eating honey, but it’s always a good idea to avoid raw honey, which is unpasteurized.

>>>We advise expectant moms to avoid eating anything that’s not pasteurized because it can carry disease-causing organisms. Most honey you buy off the shelf has been pasteurized, but be careful about honey that you buy at a fresh market or festival. Check the label to make sure that it has been pasteurized"<<<
