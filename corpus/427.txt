The did not believe that Moses was coming back...They new as long as Moses was around that the presence of God was with them...When Moses tarried on Mt. Sinai they decided to have Aaron fashion a golden calf to worship. This made them feel as though Gods presence was with them...Basically they needed some kind of image whether Moses or a golden calf to assure them of Gods presence.
