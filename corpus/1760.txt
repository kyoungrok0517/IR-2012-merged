For hair transplantation to work, you still have to have some hair.  They don't transplant hair from another person into you.  They cut hair with the follicle, usually from the back of your head (they do it in a way that you can't tell where they have taken the hair follicles) and transplant it to the bald areas of your head.  My step father had this done and it worked well.  I knew he had had it done, so I could tell, and if you looked really closely you could see that the follicles were transplanted in nice neat little rows, which didn't look natural, but again, you have to look very closely to notice.  Most people you would encounter in casual circumstances wouldn't notice because unless you closely examine your scalp, it looks natural.  He had it done more than ten years ago, so perhaps they have improved methods they can use now that result in a more natural appearance.  I'm from the US, so I don't know of any doctors in your area who can do this, but I'm sure a google search would be a good place to start locating a doctor.
