The amount of water being released is negligible. The use of ground water for our needs is hardly a concern. I believe that if you understood the hydrological cycle of water to vapor, to rain, and back again you might have a better understanding of that part of a very natural cycle that has been going on for a very, very long time. You might want to worry about something a bit more practical, such as getting proper sleep to keep yourself healthy.
