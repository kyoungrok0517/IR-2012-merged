Hi There, 

More and more women are receiving hair transplants. If you were to get one the thickness of the transplanted hair wouldn't be much different from the hair at the back of your head (the donor area). With that being said, there's a plethora of hair products designed to give your hair more body, health, and thickness. 

As for the procedure it self recovery times fluctuate from patient to patient. You can expect to feel some amount of discomfort for the first few weeks, no serious pain or anguish though. I had a Bosley hair restoration back in July and couldn't be happier with the results. I've documented every step in my hair transplantation journey at BattleAgainstBald.com. In addition to pictures and video of my procedures results, I provide a plethora of information on hair loss and other methods for correcting it. I encourage you to visit the blog, as it will answer just about every question you have. 

Best of luck to you in your battle!
-Seth
