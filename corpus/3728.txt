So I know how you feel. I used to suffer from depression.

A book that helped me was 'Becoming Your Own Therapist' by Lama Yeshe
Google the Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive and you should be able to get it for free (less the cost of shipping). Of course they may have made it a PDF by now. Of course you can message me and give me your email and I could scan it next week while I am in the Library doing research and translation.

I think something that would help would be to sit down and just think through the origins of your depression are coming from. What is causing them to arise? Is there some sort of x-factor that when you are around it, brings up those feelings? Even just something as simple as that you can kind of figure out what you need to do.
