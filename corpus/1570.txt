I have lived in both places at different times as a civilian and in the military.  Both countries have something good for retirees but if I had to choose again one over the other Thailand is still my choice.

I have (retired) friends that lived in the Philippines and they moved to Thailand.  They felt safer and believe that their life would be a little better in Thailand.

Before you make any decisions spend some time in both places.  Talk to expats in both places and see what they think.   You will find retirees in the Angeles City area, Subic Bay area and Manila. (Other areas too of course.)   Some of the places in Thailand where you will find foreign retirees will be Bangkok, Pattaya and Phuket.  

Visit first and then decide!

Thailand is my choice, I think it is safer, cleaner and the hotels are cheaper too!   Just an opinion.   In the Philippines almost everyone speaks English, they drive on the same side of the road as Canadians and Germans.  In Thailand they drive on the same side of the road as Australia and UK.   

Visit first several times.   You can fly to Manila or Bangkok and take a side trip to the other city and look around.     Do the research now before you put your money down!
