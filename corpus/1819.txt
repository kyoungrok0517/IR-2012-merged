It is really a dealers choice as long as it is straight with a good tip and feels right to you

My main stick is a players sneeky pete " With a little work done to it" but I think I paid $65 for it
I have signature sticks that cost $Ks and never shoot with them I just like my Pete and it doesnt draw attention like one of the others will.
