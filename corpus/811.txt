No-as Leonard said,you're thinking of Wolfsbane.

However,I suppose if a werewolf were dreamily standing around under the Mistletoe waiting to be kissed,you could sneak up behind him and whack him with a sock full of wet sh1t.

It may not kill him-but it'd certainly blow his chance of a kiss!

[well known fact that lady werewolves don't like kissing male werewolves that smell of old socks and wet sh1t]   True fact,that!
