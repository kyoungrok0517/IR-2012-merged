It's difficult to assess the quality of a pool cue just on specs alone. I don't know how much you're looking on spending, so I can't speak to that. I haven't tried a Players cue, but I'd probably stay away from it unless it's your very first cue and you don't want to make a better investment now. You may feel the need to upgrade in a year or two though. Everything else is feel and personal preference. I play with a 19 oz and break with an 18 oz. I have a friend who prefers all his cues at 21 oz or more. There are specialized break cues which have phenolic tips to give you more power on the break. Playing cues will have leather tips (of varying hardness and quality), but you can just as easily break with a leather tip just fine. Again, it's mostly personal preference, so go down to a pool hall, get in good with a few guys, and see if you can try some stuff out.
