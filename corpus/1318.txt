My sister Winnie asked me to enter this question because we’re looking for a drug rehabilitation center that she can enter because after months of intermittent fights, she finally gave in to the thought of being admitted to a rehab. The only condition she asked for is to be admitted to a drug rehabilitation center in Newport Beach, California because she heard that both Nicole Richie and Courtney Love were admitted there too. I don’t know how to find it so I’m asking for your help. Thanks a lot.
