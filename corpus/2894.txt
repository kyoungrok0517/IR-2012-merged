The place no one knows of and no one cares about. A small town in North Carolina located right in the middle of everything. 5 minutes from Winston-Salem and 10 minutes from Greensboro. A place where you can find the incredibly rich and the incredibly poor all in the same place and only 2 minutes away from each other. Where local high school students have nothing better to do than go to Dennys then to Walmart at 3 A.M. The only place with a shit hole 3 Dollar Cinema that shows anything but good movies. The only place where the cops do stop in old parking lots or go behind old buildings to share a dozen dounuts or smoke the weed they confiscated from the 6th grade girl whos carring her baby down the side walk to closest chink mart. The only place where the two rival high schools compete in everything from sports to who has the most STDs, the most gays and lesbians, and right down to who has the most teachers in prision for sleeping with students. A place that is quickly becoming the largest cluster fuck in the nation. 

Kernersville, North Carolina
