Its stated in your divorce decree, 
Thats why i got out after 10 years because in Texas, My ex was supposed to get half of my pension, so I'd be d***** if I was going to let her gt half after she had an adulterous affair, So I canned her behind, And got out, Now she's on skid row eating baloney and ramen noodles. You sound greedy and up to no good so I hope you get NOTHING! Work for a living and get your own benefits!
