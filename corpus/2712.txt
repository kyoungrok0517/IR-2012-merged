The question is: would they still consider lowering the legal age to 16 if they knew that this could put their own children at risk? (took out the unnecessary word appropriate and changed is to if and changed would to could)

Peer pressure is one of the main links to under-age alcohol abuse and lowing the legal drinking age would increase this. It would also make alcohol a lot more accessible and available for anyone. Binge Drinking is also commonly popular amongst teens and extremely dangerous. Lowing the legal drinking age and making alcohol more accessible would increase the numbers of these type of events. (took out some words to combine the first and second sentance I think it sounds better, took out the letter a after binge drinking is also... changed number to numbers changed these to this)

Alcohol has many side-effects which can be influential for the rest of our lives. It has physical as well as psychological effects. Change this sentance to: Alcohol has many physical and psychological side effects.

I edited some of your grammer, and took out a few words in the process hope this helps :)
