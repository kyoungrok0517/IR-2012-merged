It stands for temporal mandibular joint.   It is the joint where your jaw connects to your head.  The best way to reduce the pain is soft foods for 6 weeks.  I also you Ibuprofen (recommend by my doctor).  After 6 weeks of soft food you can add in regular food but avoid that bad stuff like gum, hard thins, popcorn....etc


You can also get a referral for a physical therapist that specializes in TMJ.  I personally have been able to keep my pain down to minimal to none without PT.  But it is out there...
