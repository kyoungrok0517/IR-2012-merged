It's about an overweight man, kind of an introvert, meets a lady who sort of changes his world.   He lived with his mother.   He was totally in his own world, and (with good humor) didn't like the outside much.

The book was written by some author; and published posthumously.  I believe the author suffered from depression or something.

I'm trying to remember the name of the book so I can re-read it.   The main character's name was Ignatio or something like that?  It was a long-winded blustery title to the book.  A funny read, too.
