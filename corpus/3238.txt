Short answer....nobody knows.

Long answer.  Although alot is known about how pheromones work in animals, very little is actually known about how they work in humans.  Because, the truth is that humans lack the VNO (the part of the nose that detects pheromones).  They shouldn't work in humans.  However, they do, in fact work.....quite well.  There is a rather large commercial pheromone industry with thousands of customers who can attest, through direct experience, what they do.

The real problem here is that research scientists simply ignore the field of human pheromones.  Quite odd considering its well studied in many lower lifeforms.  Even more odd considering the profit motive for products that could come out of such research.  Instead, various small companies experiment with this, with various degrees of success.

Most of the useful information on this can be found on the Pherotalk Forum run by Androtics Direct (the best producer of pheromones for human use).
