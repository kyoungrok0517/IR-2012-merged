I'm new so I don't know where your question came from.  The Bible talks about the world being ended by the flood of Noah's day.  Maybe that's your point. This book will quite often use the word 'world' to describe the current collection of governments and lifestyles that are prevalent in the world.  For e.g. Jesus was quoted as saying: "If YOU were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because YOU are no part of the world, but I have chosen YOU out of the world, on this account the world hates YOU‚Äù The actual earth wasn't what was referred to here because it can't hate anyone.
But if that's not what you are talking about; your right in a way, the actual earth in whatever form can't be destroyed because then you would have to destroy the energy that holds the matter on earth together.  No one can do that.  Even if every atom on earth came apart, the energy will still be somewhere.
