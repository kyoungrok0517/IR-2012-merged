My friend and I are looking for a tough working and comfortable pick up truck, we wanted to get the Chevrolet Silverado, but all the trims and models are freaking us out.  There are the HD1500, HD2500, and HD3500 and I do not know what is all the big differences between these 3, and the next hard part is all the trims, like the LT or LTZ or what ever.  Please tell me what is the difference between all the models and trims, or any suggestions to get which one of the model and trim.  Thank you.
And should I get the 4WD or the 2WD?
