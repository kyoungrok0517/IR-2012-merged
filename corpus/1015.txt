You don't say the name of the ship so it's hard to say weather it will be a drag. 
I'm sure your parents have taken into consideration your age group activities.

On some ships they have rock wall climbing, Ice rinks, surf simulator on board, shows, movies, teen clubs. Plus you get to meet other teens your age. 

Don't forget the great ports you will be stopping at and get a chance to snorkel, scuba, zip lining through the forest, cave swimming etc.

Give it a chance, if you know the name of the ship check  out what actual activities they have on board at cruisecritic.com 

enjoy and good luck)
