It isn't.  And it doesn't cause *botulism*, either.  There is an extremely low possibility that a baby who eats honey would get infant botulism (which is as different from botulism as measles is from German measles), but almost all babies survive with no long-term problems.  A baby only has a 1 in 40,000 chance of getting infant botulism at all, and the vast majority of these are from soil or dirt and *not* from honey.  It is recommended that babies not be given honey because of a tiny risk--and honey isn't needed anyway.
