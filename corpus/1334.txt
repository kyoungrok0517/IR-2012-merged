hey!
I live in Newport Beach, California. I buy all my postcards from this website. check it out: http://www.izand.com. I haven't found any better postcards in orange county, California better than theirs. they also sell postcards from Huntington Beach, Seal Beach, Laguna Beach, Balboa Island I guess. you may also use their free ecards service which is soooo cool!
have a nice day!
