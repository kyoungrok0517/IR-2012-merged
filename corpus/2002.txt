All due respects to Mr. Hillary but no, I don't believe that this particular category of ''Adventurer''
can have a ''best''..many others of Hillary's day performed spectacular adventures that were perilous,exciting and first.
Everest is the tallest mountain,he did it first,a feat thought impossible.
Neil Armstrong was first on the Moon,no one else can claim that either...and like Hillary,Armstrong demonstrated that nothing is impossible if you want it enough.
