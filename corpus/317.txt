You may be right about holding in the toxins by not pooping...but if you think about it, the same amount of toxins are always in you anyway...with the fast, you're just not replenishing them at your normal rate.  All the toxins you started with move to your bowels during the fast...and everything that is still moving around in your body (e.g., your blood) is, for once, free of all the food-related toxins we normally add on a regular basis.
