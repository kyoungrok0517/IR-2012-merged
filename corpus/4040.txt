Yes, you can use them to make hot water for the house, supplementing your hot water heater. These panels have just been made mandatory in Hawaii. During the summer, when you don't need to heat the pool, you could add a valve and piping to send the water from the panels to your hot water heater.

"imintowater" has a point, you wouldn't want to use the same water for the pool as for drinking water, and you'd have to valve the system to prevent mixing, unless you installed a heat exchanger so that the fluid that goes through the panels just transfers heat to the drinking water without mixing with it.
