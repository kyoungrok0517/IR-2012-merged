Yep, you get your Y from your dad, who got it from his dad, and your mitochondria from your mom, who got them from her mom. The rest of the DNA you get half from your dad and half from your mom (you've got two copies of each of your chromosomes, one from your mom and one from your dad). So, your mom got half of her DNA from your grandfather and half from your grandmother, and you got half your DNA from her, so you should have about 25% of your DNA from your grandfather on your mom's side, so you should be able to tell that he's your grandfather. 

Hope that was reasonably clear.
