I just think she generally has bad luck. If you look at her past relationships or flings e.g Gerrard Butler, it kind of proves it, which is a shame as she does seem to be a very nice person. I also think she may be scared to commite herself again after what happened with her and Brad and is just looking for a bit of fun. However it may all be a facade, and she does actually want to settle down and is upset that she cant find "the one" but just puts on a brave face. Who knows?
