Bravo to you for trying something different. How does that saying go "do what you've always done, get what you have always gotten". There is no reward without risk.

That being said, it sounds to me you are buying a PRE-foreclosure and not a house that has already foreclosed. What is the difference? If the house foreclosed, then the second lien holders loses out completely. The first lien gets the property, and sells it at auction. That is why when you are buying a pre-foreclosure, you can often buy the second lien holder out for pennies on the dollar. And the first lien holder is ultimately going to lose out if it goes to auction (or worse, if it doesn't sell at auction and they now own it). Therefor, you are in a good position to negotiate with them too. You may even be able to buy it subject to financing - meaning you assume the original loan (at a discounted amount if you bargain with them).
