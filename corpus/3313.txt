I don't think that there should be school uniforms in public schools. I'm against school uniforms because people (mostly girls) express themselves through what clothes they wear. Someone who want to be independent usually wear outfits that other people normally don't. I do think that schools should have a dress code. I mean, Girls shouldn't be wearing mini skirts or cut off shirts. But sometimes, creativity and can express someone's feelings or personalites. What do you all think?
