You could try Hydrocotyle Asiatica tincture (5 drops in 1/2 cup water twice daily) available from homoepathic stores. Hydrocotyle Asiatica is a herb and has no side effects. You can continue for life (daily once ) after the obesity is gone. Very good for endocrine glands and fights ageing, ask your doctor. I would recommend this for you and please, do not over-eat.
