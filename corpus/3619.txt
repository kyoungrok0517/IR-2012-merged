Sun beds have much for UVA rays than the sun, so basically they're putting you at a higher risk for cancer, wrinkles, freckles, bad skin, etc. 


I wouldn't say it's worth it. Try Nuetrogena or Jergen's gradual tanning lotions. They're gentle and give great color! If you're still allergic, than try some others.


I don't want to be one of those old, ugly hags when I get older just because I wanted a tan when I was younger.


Good luck ;)
