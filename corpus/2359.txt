From my knowledge tornadoes are formed when a Thunderstorm is usually present and there is I think cool air above a layer of warm air, the winds-(storm cell) pick up in a circular motion and the warm air gets to spinning until a funnel cloud forms and starts rotating until it's fast enough to form a full tornado.

nationalgeographic.com -A tornado forms when changes in wind speed and direction create a horizontal spinning effect within a storm cell. This effect is then tipped vertical by rising air moving up through the thunderclouds.
