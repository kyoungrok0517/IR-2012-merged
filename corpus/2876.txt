Orange Park  28 up, 9 down   
 A town outside of Jacksonville, FL. Orange Park was founded as the premier orange growing city in Florida, but as winter provided minor freezes, founders realized they had to take orange growing farther into south Florida. 

Orange Park is a normal suburban town with a mall, movies, stores, high schools, and nieghborhoods. 
"I didn't feel like getting shot for walking around outside, so I moved from Jacksonville to Orange Park."
