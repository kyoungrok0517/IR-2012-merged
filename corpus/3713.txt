On the road to spiritual wisdon ofcourse. Life is so fragile and we tend to forget in the mist of gathering and hording that we were born with nothing and will leave with nothing. What matters is the experience we have. Who knows if we can take that with us where we go when we die. Also anything you have at anytime can be taken away from you. You could also be in the shoes of someone who has never had a thing. What can never be taken away from you is your experience, your mind and principles. Discovering myself and finding the beauty in the things that matter most and that opens my mind and enrich my thoughts is what is most important to me in this life and it is what i wish for all people.
