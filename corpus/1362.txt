There is 24.12% Ca in CaCitrate. The normal tablet with Vit D contains 315 mg Ca and the normal dosage is 2 tablets twice a day.  That will give you a little over 1200 mg per day.
If your bone density test shows an S.D. of -2.0 or lower(absolute)  then you probably should take 5 tablets daily with about 200 I.U. of D per tablet. That is leaning to Osteoporosis. If S.D.  is more than -2.0 (absolute) this is leaning to osteopenia and 1000 -1200 mg daily will suffice. It is water soluble and very well absorbed in the stomach.

Calcium orotate is very complex, low in % Ca and is not well absorbed although it is intrinsically very similar to natural acid salts already in the body (bones). I don't believe it is as effective as CaCitrate.

Mg is not of well known importance to the bone resorption process when Ca and Vit D are taken as supplements.
It is obviously involved in the  bone resorption cycle but not necessarily needed to be supplemented per se.
