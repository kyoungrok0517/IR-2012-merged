Yes, these frogs are good for beginners, but you will need something larger than a critter tote. These frogs (White's and Blue Bumpy) grow to an average of 4 inches long, and they are a heavy bodied frog. A general rule of thumb is 10 gallons of enclosure space per frog. 

You will also need a basking temp of about 85 F positioned to one side of the enclosure (to create a temp gradient), and using a ceramic heat emitter, red or dark blue incandescent bulb will allow to to view your frogs easier. Most frogs and toads are nocturnal by nature. 

The humidity needs to be kept high, around 60 - 70% at all times. Using a lightly moistened and well mixed substrate will help with this. Coconut coir bedding, like jungle bed and bead-a-beast, or organic potting soil (no added chemicals or Perlite) are acceptable choices.

These frogs are insectivores and require live insects for feeding. This means you will have to "keep" the insects as well as your reptile (food and water), unless you want to to buy the insects every day (for baby frogs.) Adults can eat a few times a week, but it can still be tiresome. Calcium supplementation is required for captive reptiles, as they are prone to calcium deficiency. Dust insects with calcium powder a few times a week to prevent this potentially deadly condition.
