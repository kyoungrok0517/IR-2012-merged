I have a ford ranger 1995 that was hit on the driver front wheel and it is bent in. The car still runs (just need some work on bending the wheel back out). There are tons of parts that can be salvaged off the truck. I live in baltimore and i am looking just to get a little bit og extra cash to put toward a new one. Does anyone know of a place that will tow and pay me for the parts?
