The holy trinity of collectibles is Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Ty Cobb, with Ruth towering head and shoulders above all the competition. Babe Ruth was larger than baseball. Whatever he touched has turned to gold. A ball signed by Ruth has sold for as high as $42,500 and as low as $100 depending on the signature's condition.

If you want to find out the value just google your question... Do some research about it through websites and you will find your answer.

Best of Luck.
