Phermones do work, but you don't have to buy any.  Your body produces them and sends them out naturally.  They are in your sweat for example.  When you kiss someone, you are exchanging phermones with him/her.  However, phermones cannot make you fall in love.  For example, if you are not visually attracted to someone, you would not even consider kissing him/her, giving the phermones no chance to work.  Even if you kiss someone who is repulsive, you may lose the attraction after the kiss when you take a look at that person.  Finally, you want that special someone to fall in love with you, not your phermones.  Correct?
