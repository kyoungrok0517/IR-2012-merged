GOD knows your situation but are you telling us that you are too arrogant to pray a little harder and ask for HIS help? Remember (this applies to all religions), GOD helps those who help themselves. You are like a spoilt child. 'HE knows we want something why can't HE give us.'

If you ask me, you do need to fast. You need to be a little more humble.
