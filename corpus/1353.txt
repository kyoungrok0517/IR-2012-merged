If you think supplements are not healthy you are either an idiot or very misinfomed. There is no difference between calcium you get in a supplement and the calcium you ingest from food.

EDIT: Look, I don't want to be an ass, but this kind of thought bugs the crap out of me. Chemically there is no differance between some compound that grew in a tree and the same compound made in some lab somewhere. The stuff you get in a supplement is the same stuff you'd be ingesting naturally. People get the idea that somehow "organic" is better because of clever marketing. Scientifically their ideas have no standing. Calcuim is calcuim. It's a freaking element! There is no possible way it could be any different.
