Way short. That amount will last you a couple of years or five? Or you could live like a pauper on $8,500/yr (10% of $85,00 if you can find 10%).

According to the Bloomberg.com calculator, if you currently have $85,000 and put in $5,000/yr for 40 yrs, you would have about $800,000 at age 65, calculated at 6% compounded interest. Sounds like a lot, but for 20 more years, it's not; still only a comfortable $40,000 per year. Those retirement homes are $2,000 - $5,000 per month.
