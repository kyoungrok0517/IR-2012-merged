In the middle of the night I woke up and when I moved the bottom of my jaw to the left I could feel the bones pop and go back in place when I moved my jaw to its original position. It just happened all of a sudden! Up till now my jaw does lock, but I don't feel it pop like it did. It still does pop and it hurts.

My mom told me I have TMJ and started listing family members (including herself) that have it.

What is TMJ and what does the dentist do about it?
