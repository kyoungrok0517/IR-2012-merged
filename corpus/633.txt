I cain't explain the science of it. I do note that when the calender designates one day over another and time of day for peak animal activity I do see a difference. As for deer moving in the day it's usually related to heat, hunger or thirst. Deer like a sunny spot in the morning of a cold day shade in the heat of the day an early evening and morning snack and drink before heading to beading areas during the day and feeding area's at night. I have seen also deer attracted to sprinkler systems for a water resource and these were set at 5am or 5pm deer were nearly always about. Now do deer wear a timex? I don't know but they never seemed to miss being there at the right time.
