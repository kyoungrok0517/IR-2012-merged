If it's a scar you've had your whole life there's no topical product you could use now that would get rid of it. You could look into some medical procedures - like chemical peels, or laser treatments depending on how deep the scar is. It's very expensive but it could be a great investment if this scar is really effecting your life. Otherwise a camouflage body makeup (for scars and tattoos) would hide it temporarily day to day.
