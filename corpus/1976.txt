My town is famous for windstorms and tornadoes.
It's called "Broadway" because the first European settlers found this big open broad area in the midst of a pine forest.
After they settled they found out it was open area because tornadoes come through regularly and knock down all the large trees.  (talk about a revolting development!!)
