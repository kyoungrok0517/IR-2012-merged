On cycle day 3. There are a lot of different levels to test like FSH and progesterone but if you have found your estrogen levels are low you need to get treatment for that. Estrogen is responsible for plumping the lining of the uterus making it hospitable to a pregnancy. Also, it is very common for women with low estrogen levels not to ovulate at all. Your doctor may want to start with your estrogen levels first because it is and easy fix before putting you through rigorous and expensive testing. If I were in your shoes and you have been TTC for awhile, I would ask for a FSH and progesterone test at the least. They are just 2 simple blood test you get on CD3 as well that will provide valuable information.

Good luck!
