On a plane, it will take you close to about 7-9 hours, with a stopover.  I routinely do Florida to California and that's what it takes.  Although, that's actual flight time.  If you leave NC at 6pm EST, you will be able to arrive around 10 or 11pm PST with the three hour time change.  On the trip back, remember to give yourself a full day to travel.  You lose those 3 hours and it will take you a full day to get back.
