Hi, yes I traveled on Serenade of the Seas and I absolutly loved it.  It is a smaller Royal Caribbean ship, but that doesn't take away from it's qualities.  My favorite part of the ship is the Solarium.. also the Vortex nightclub has a rotating bar.  Very fun.  As for the islands, I recommend to defiantly do a rainforest tour.  I rode a 4x4 through the rainforest, so much fun.  Also in, I think St. Lucia, we climbed the waterfalls.  Have fun and enjoy the ship, tell the staff I said hello ;)
