Camels were first domesticated at around 2000 BCE.

Camel trivia: the old story of the Biblical patriarch Abraham was first written down in about 600 BCE, when domesticated camels were common, and camels became part of the story. But analysis of Abraham's journey indicates that he traveled on older, pre-camel trade routes, suggesting that he lived and traveled in a time that predated common use of domesticated camels.
