Exactly, there is a special frequency which is reserved for traffic announcements which the radio stations are allowed to switch on for traffic announcements only (usually depicted as a TA or TP on the stereo). If your stereos supports it, then it automatically changes to this frequency so you can here the updated situation.
 
1) It can be annoying on certain times of the day when the frequency is constantly used during rush hour and you can't listen to you Cd's

2) There were a number of cases where the radio stations were fined for leaving this frequency switched on even after the traffic announcements and getting advertising across the air! Sneaky!

Hope this answers your question
