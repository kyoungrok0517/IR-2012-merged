-- Their is nothing about the Mayan calendar that predicts the end of the world
-- The planets will *not* align dangerously in 2012. In fact it's virtually impossible for them all to align perfectly
-- The solar system has passed through the galactic equator over and over again since our solar system was born and nothing bad has or can ever happen
-- Earth's magnetic poles can *not* reverse within one year's time. Such reversals are rare and require hundreds of years to complete
-- Planet Nibiru, also known as Planet 'X' doesn't exist. Even if it did it would have to be very close already for it to get here in just two years. If it was that close, it would have been spotted, even by amateur astronomers with small telescopes.
-- The super-massive black hole at the center of our galaxy is simply too far away to present any danger to us
-- I think that's most of the scary stuff you might have heard. Lots more about 2012 here =>http://www.2012hoax.org/
