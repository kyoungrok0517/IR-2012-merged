I saw a write-up, not a survey, several weeks ago regarding Senior Migration.  That's what it's called.  You might try checking for surveys under that kind of heading.

Anyway, It said that many of the folks who had headed to Florida and the Southwest, were returning to the North.  It had become too expensive for them and declining health. Their families were in the North.  

Also, there are many Senior Communities popping up in places like Idaho, Wyoming and North Dakota.  Surprising isn't it?

Here's the strange part of it all, it seems that this migration and return "home" is happening in many, many families.  Kind of like the parents want a vacation from the kids for a while, and then they return.

I'm a Consulting Societal Gerontologist and this type of information is always interesting to me.  I'm currently doing a book myself.

I just had one last thought, or two.  Try an Internet search for Senior Migration patterns, it may or may not turn up something. Also, there are a number of Universities that are doing research with the Senior population.  Try Senior Research on the net.  Hope this is helpful and I know you're resourceful and will find all that you need.

Good Luck with your book!
