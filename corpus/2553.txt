Okay, I won't ask questions - I'll just attempt to answer yours, how's that? 

Since Shrek, Pirates of the Caribbean, & Spiderman are extremely popular, you can't go wrong with something from any of those movies. Ghost Rider was awesome, as well.
Go as the Invisible Man - he wore clothing but his head & hands were wrapped in bandages & he wore a hat & dark glasses. Superman or any of the SuperHeroes is popular & easy. Wear a sheet & get a big plastic pumpkin, cut out the bottom & put that on your head with glowsticks in the pumpkin so it really shows up.  Be Puss N Boots or a Musketeer. My son wanted to be Zorro when he was 5, it turned out great - you can do that easily & you'll be very handsome as Zorro, with the mask, the cape, the sword!!
Hope these help.
