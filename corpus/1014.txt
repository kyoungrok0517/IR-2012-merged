Im going on a cruise this summer and im soooo excited, but i was just wondering what your feedback was on royal carribean cruise lines for poeple who are 15-18? Me and some people in this age group are going but we've heard this one can be a drag for kids, i hope its not true! haha.

any feedback is helpful! thanks!
