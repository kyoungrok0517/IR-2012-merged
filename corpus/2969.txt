I mean the main part of believing is not trying to look for facts.
I am an atheist, but it was never a matter of if god existed or not. 
You can try to prove me that there is a god all day I still donâ€™t want to believe in him.
It's just all the question here evolves on "facts"?
But you can't talk about religion and facts and proofs in the same time

I mean most people hear. And I don't want to be insulting. But I will be. Are really really stupid.  Think that Christianity says that Jesus is physically sitting up in the sky on a cloud with his gay little angels and some day he gona come down. 
Religions were like that in biblical tams but since then it has developed and became more abstract.
Then America was born and it all came backward... 

So again what I am asking can you give such a physical interpretation to religion with facts and proofs.
