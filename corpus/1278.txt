Yes, it is possible for them to track where you are. Actually, the tracking device is the phone they issued you. They installed a tracking software so whenever you go to work, they log you in, and log you out whenever you leave.

If that's not the case, then I believe that they are using your computer's IP address to confirm that you sent the email from the computer in your booth. 

Don't attempt to go around the system because I'm sure they'll discover it.
