Please do not say 'everyday." I am aware that earthquakes are happening 'all the time," but I'm meaning earthquakes that can actually be felt haha Is earthquakes a problem anywhere in Colorado?

Also, if an earthquake happened in/near Denver, would it be felt more strongly than an earthquake of the same magnitude somewhere else?
