Mt town lost allot of people during the war of independence! Allot of grave sites around proving this. Without their sacrifice we would have no USA. They fought for independence all the way from Indiana. That is part of my national heritage. I am sorry to get off track. We have nothing but graves. That is enough proof for me!
