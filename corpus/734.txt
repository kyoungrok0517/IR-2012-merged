Dogs shouldn't have to sleep outside,especially small,short-haired ones. But I would say if it is below 55 degrees,that it's too cold for the dog to sleep outside.You go and try sleeping outside.

Edit: A little defensive,aren't you? I guess your family sleeps outside? Why did you even bother to ask the question when it's obvious that you're going to make the dog sleep outside anyway?
