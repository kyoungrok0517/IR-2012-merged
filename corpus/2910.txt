Luana, Garden City, Kansas
A pretty girl who often is judged for being a show-off, attention seeker but in truth just wants to be different from other girls and doesn't like people judging her from her face. 
Bitch: Luana is such a bitch! I hate her. 
Luana's friend: That's not true. You dont even know her.
