No, Purell would not have stopped the Black Plague in Europe. 

There were three forms of the plague. Namely, septicemic, bubonic, and pneumonic. Septicemic was the infection of the blood, pneumonic is the infection of the lungs and bubonic was the infection of the lymph nodes.

The only way to treat plague is through antibiotics and only if caught in it's early stages. Preventative measures would include: vaccines, controlling of rats and fleas as well as educating people. One could catch the plague through flea or infected rat bites, inhaling of airborne droplets of infected people or animals (those who had the pneumonic plague), or direct contact with infected body fluids or tissue.
 
In any case, I imagine that your character would have a difficult time not catching the plague herself unless she had the proper vaccinations as well as medication in the event that she would fall ill. Maybe she herself would have some medical background?
