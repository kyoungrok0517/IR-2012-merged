Hum.. Let me dig deep for this one. The alligeaver is a fresh water mammal like reptile. It lives in small packs and feeds on fish, small mammals and bird's eggs. Found only in marshes and swamps, the alligeaver bears live young and creates a dam like nest in the water to protect themselves and their young. When the babies reach the age of about 1 year or, they will begin to accompany their mothers and learn hunting and survival skills. The alligeaver is threatened only be man for it is regularly poached for it's unique furry reptilian skin. The alligeaver is a strong swimmer and a stealthy hunter. It has a complex 4 chambered heart and is able to slow it's heart rate and metabolism down in order to conserve energy. The Australian platypus is a relative to the alligeaver. Try that.
