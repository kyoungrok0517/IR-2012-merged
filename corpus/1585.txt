Im planning to retire in the Phillipines and was wondering whether 300,000 is enough to last me the rest of my life.  Its will be in a savings account, so there will be some sort of income.  Im 23, but planning my retirement when Im 45,50ist.  Also do i need  a US adress if my bank is the bank of america?
