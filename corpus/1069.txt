I don't know about towing or anything, exactly how good of a condition is it in?  I'm guessing its not drivable but I'm sure any salvage yard will take it though I can't recommend any towing services, if you wanted it repaired I know a great body shop in Bel Air.  But (and I'm not sure about this) there is a CarMax in White Marsh that might give you some money for it (so long as it runs) but you'd have to get it there.

Not sure this was much help...
