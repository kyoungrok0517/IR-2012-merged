Okay here's  a list of areas to not walk around

mainly at night anyway:

Gay St.
Park Heights
Edmondson Village
Lexington Market
Belair Rd.
Mondawmin Mall area

that should be enough

Baltimore is just like any other city. You got your crime and pollution. All the stuff that makes a city a city. Our harbor is polluted so play near it at your own risk. Our school system sucks cuz some people like spending budgets on donuts and vacations. That's about it really. We got really good hotels though and the Gallery is the best place to shop downtown as well as the Harbor Place.
