Surgery is the only option unless it's fairly fresh.  If it's fresh, try mederma, it'll help a bit but not totally.  I don't know how much the surgery is but I think it depends on the doctor, how bad the scar is, what kind of surgery will need to be done and so forth.  Consultations are usually free so set up an appointmen.  Find a doctor that is board certified and specializes in the skin. Research the doctor thoroughly and remember if he's really cheap than there is probably a reason.  Most doctors will set up a payment plan now, that should help.
