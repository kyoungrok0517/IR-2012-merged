emphysema, lung cancer...

if you really want to impress your teacher; talk about the body going into hypoxic drive.

basically it works like this: your chemo-receptors see an increase in carbon dioxide and tell you to breathe so you can exhale the CO2. Eventually, with diseases like emphysema and COPD, your body no longer worries about CO2, simply because it needs to worry about getting proper amounts of Oxygen instead. So the chemorecepters go "hey brain, need some O2; let's breathe!" and you breathe. These people are usually the ones on home oxygen, who can barely say anything without taking a breath, and sometimes need a fan just to feel like they're breathing adequately.
