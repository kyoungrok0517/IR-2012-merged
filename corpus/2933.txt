Corey the last thing we need is for the outside world to precieve the U.S. as a good place to live. our current estimated pop. is 300,000,000 thats alot.  I completely agree with you though and then some I believe that america is the greatest country to have ever existed, or that will ever exist.
I beleive that this country and its people as of right now are the image of God on earth. If this country over populates as India has or allowys a culture belief shift there will probably be a holacost against  the substanial dominate culture.
