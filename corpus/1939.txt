I'm interested in knowing what the name of a community of Vikings would be. I know that lots of peoples in historic Russia and Mongolia and America are called Tribes, and the communities of Scotland are (of course) Clans. What would it be for Vikings? Tribe of Vikings doesn't sound right. Clan is probably better, but I can't find any information naming what those clans would be. Can anyone help?
