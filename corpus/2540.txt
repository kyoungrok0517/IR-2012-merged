A really easy costume is "Carrie" or dead prom queen.  I have also been a saloon girl, the tooth fairy, Little Bo Peep, a harem girl ( I guess I really like girly stuff).  Another kind of cute, easy idea is an artist.  You could wear an over sized white shirt, a beret, and then pencil in a little mustache and carry a paint brush.
