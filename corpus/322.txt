well im fasting for ramadan but if ur talking about a non-spiritual strictly diet fasting, u have to be careful. people tend to gain weight from fasting because when it comes time to break fast, they gorge themselves. and when the body is not getting regular meals and is going long periods without food the body converts greater percentages of its food to fat. i would recommend u fast from food but still drink water so u dont put too much strain on ur kidneys. and if ur gonna start ur fast at sunrise and eat at sunset, u need to do any exercising u plan on doing a couple hours after starting ur fast so ur body still has enough energy to build muscle. if u wait too long till ur stomach is completely empty then ur body will break down muscle for energy, which will hurt ur metabolism. also, when u start ur fast, eat a big meal. but when u break it, eat normally.
