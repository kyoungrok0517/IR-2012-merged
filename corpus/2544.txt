How 'bout a 'funky' witch?  Find a cheap black tulle skirt/tutu (ebay has a ton) and wear over some striped neon tights (costume stores have them everywhere for under $5)  Wear a plain black shirt and find a cheap witch hat...... You could get a neon green or orange wig to wear underneath (coordinate the color with the striped tights...) Cute, different, fun.... :)
