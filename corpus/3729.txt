There is very effective help available through the spoken meditation method developed in the 13 th century by Nichiren. The group that teaches it is called SGI and i know many people in it that have gained great benefit through the practice. There is no charge for learning the method.


Dump Depression
By Generalist
I always had clinical depression without knowing it. My life was so bad that I didn’t know that others were not just lucky. They weren’t traumatized and depressed.
The complete collapse of my finances created a rip that forced me to let light in. It forced me to examine what I had been doing with my mind and body. Religion had already disgusted me with the cruelty and corruption of the Catholic Church in Austria. I was open to any other suggestions on how to gain in life. 
At a SGI-USA meeting, I found out that the method for doing that had all been summarized as Nam Myoho Renge Kyo by the monk Nichiren. He lived in 13th century Japan. Here is the, "just add hot water" version of his doctrine.
1-Everything is always changing, yet, there is a continuity of life and truth. That’s Kyo. It also came to mean vibration, speech, teaching, sutra.
 2-Causes produce effects. Sometimes this is not obvious because of time gaps between the cause and the appearance of effects. That’s Renge.
3-Life is both physical and non-physical. That’s Myoho.
4-I needed to organize my mind according to what’s real in order to win. That’s Nam.
I started to recite Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. It took some time to discard my cynicism, even when I got phenomenal results in my life and felt completed. I later found that joining with others enhances the effectiveness and gets me a big source of potential friends.
