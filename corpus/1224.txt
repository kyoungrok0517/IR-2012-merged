It depends.
I live in the US, and I saw that US has allowed loads of imported cars,  from the Efficient and cheap Daewoos to the absolutely poor Yugos. 

Recently, Daewoo returns with cars under Chevrolet Names (Daewoo Kalos is Chevrolet Aveo/ Aveo5). Also, Alfa-Romeo, Fiat, and Smart are coming to the US soon, and the US is trying some from the Chinese manufacturers such as Brilliance, Chery, Great Wall, and Geely.

There is some Rumors of Skoda cars having US production by around 2012, being rebadged as Volkswagens (Skoda is a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group anyway). The Skoda Roomster is predicted to be Volkswagen's entry-level minivan in the US, to rival the Mazda 5.

I hope they do. I like the design of the new Fabia hatchbacks.     (I sometimes check out the cars not known in the US, since I trust they may come soon)
