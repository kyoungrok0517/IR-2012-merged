There are a number of savings plans for children 529 plans (for college funding) and UTMA/UGMA accounts (uniform Transfer/Gifts to minor accounts). They both have some tax advantages. As for savings bonds they generally earn a low interest. If you account for inflation and taxes they generally have a break even or negative return rate (example 4% interest earned -1% taxes and 3% inflation). So I suggest a mutual fund the easiest pick is an index fund one that owns some of all the companies in the index (Dow, S&P, Russell). Stocks over many years have earned 10 to 11% that means about every seven years your money doubles. The best thing then is to start saving now. Based on this formula in seven years $1000 becomes $2000, in fourteen years $4000 and twenty one years $8000. With the savings bonds example your money doubles in about 18 years.
