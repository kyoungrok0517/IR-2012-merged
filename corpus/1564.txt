I am thinking about retiring in about 10 years and I want to start planning. If I stay at my current job, I can retire with about $2950 per month (a little under 100 per day). 

I would like to retire overseas. I am concidering Thailand and the Philippines.

Which one would be cheaper? Which one has the better quality of life for retirees?
