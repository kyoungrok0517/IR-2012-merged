My daughter graduated from Corona del Mar High School, but it was a few years ago:)  ... She and her friends actually "hung out" at each other's houses.  Fashion Island IS a nearby mall, but it's not that large.  South Coast Plaze (and Crystal Court) is huge; and that's where they'd go .....  Actually, they would go to Disneyland After Dark alot too ... and, of course, hang out at the beach ... or the Balboa Bay Club.  The Crab Cooker is a restaurant that everyone wanders into; and we'd all gone to Magic Island a few times.  I can't remember the name of the Mexican restaurant that she worked at (with some of her friends), but it was near Lido Island too...
