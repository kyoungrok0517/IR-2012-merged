Lava lamps that I've come across require an E14 screw bulb.  The heat from this melts the wax etc etc.  With all bulbs being replaced within 2 years what would I have to use in my lamp?  Do energy efficient ones produce enough heat to keep my lava lamp working, also are they too big due to the motor on the base of them?
