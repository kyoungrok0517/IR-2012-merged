I have TMJ & had it for years.  Since May, I've been having procedures for 2 chronic root canal infections and other teeth.  I've had a nightguard made & it helps alot.  I want to know if I should see oral surgeon or is this from all the procedures and infection in that area?  Are there therapies or something for this pain?
