I've recently been doing Biblical research for the last few months.  I have been in several libraries, spoken to many theologians, professors, etc. and I am having trouble finding any empirical evidence that Moses of the Old Testament actually existed.  Furthermore I'm having trouble finding out whether the majority of the claims were actually demonstrated.  If someone could please point me to a recent source of information that hasn't already been refuted by several other people in the same field, please help me out.  Thanks!
