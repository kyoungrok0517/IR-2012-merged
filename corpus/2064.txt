To be honest, the best way to learn about skateboarding is to try it or go to a local skatepark and watch for awhile. Certain tricks like ollies are something you might want to learn about. It's a huge industry and for background, check out wiki. Tony Hawk is the basic famous skateboarder to look at, although highly over used.
