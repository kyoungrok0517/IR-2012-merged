The agony that the Parents are going through can only be imagined. You can see by some of the unsympathetic and even mocking answers in this column that there are evil to stupid people about who should themselves be consulting a psychiatrist. You have to be exceptionally stupid to go to the trouble to make a mocking answer to the kidnap of a little child and publish it.
The parents do not need to be castigated for leaving the child alone. It is an everyday practise that normally does not result in a kidnap.
I am sure that Intelligent people will sympathise with the McCanns and also be incredulous at the total stupidity of the Portuguese Police
