I would be proud of a man who sacrificed to allow me life. I would be grateful and remember that sacrifice every day. If someone sacrificed to save my child's life that feeling would double. Despite what so many seem to think, I believe that in a crunch, most men would still make this ultimate sacrifice.

Beep--awesome explanation.
