If you go through rotc and earn a commission you can retire after 20 good years of service.  If you are active duty and you retire, you can immediately draw your military pension.  If you are a reserve, you have to wait until age 60 - some time can be knocked off for deployments but not that much.  An officer is not guaranteed a career in the military.  Promotion from 2lt to 1lt is automatic but all promotions afterward require you to submit a promotion packet.  Competition for captain is not that bad but it gets harder as you go and if you do not make major and are not prior service, you will not get the 20 years that you need for retirement.  You have to continuously meet education and physical fitness standards. In addition, officers can be kicked out for things like dui.  

While you are in, you must continuously meet civilian and military education requirements.  Most officers try to earn their master's degrees prior to putting in their promotion packet for major.  This means that you will probably have a masters degree along with your 4 year degree.  If you are smart, you will get one that will make you marketable in the civilian world.  Generally speaking, most officers have decent civilian jobs when they get out.  Many go into business or even education.
