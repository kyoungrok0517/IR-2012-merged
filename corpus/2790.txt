I don't know where Eyam is, but I would guess there would be little to do. In those days there was not even knowledge of germs, they probably thought illness was 'evil spirits', although I am sure they understood it spread from one person to another and getting around a person who had it meant you could. They may have also understood if someone had survived before they might be immune, although they would have had no idea why. Quarantine was the only form of protection, the houses where the sick were could not be entered by anybody and people in there could not leave. 

People would probably try and get food and water to the family of the sick people, but maybe would not go into the houses. Bodies were probably taken from the houses and dumped somewhere to be burned. I think sometimes all of their belongings might be burned, too.

I would have thought some of the panic and the way people were treated with diseases, like lepers in the Bible or stories about the Plague were so ridiculous until the AIDS epidemic came along and even medical personnel would not want to treat an AIDS patient until they knew what caused it. Living at the time of the Plague must have been horrible and really, I don't think there was much to do to help the victims.
