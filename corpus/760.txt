Lets compare lumens, Philips advertises its 200A23 and 200PS30 at 3900/3800 lumens, according to the Feit Electric catalog you will need a 65W cfl.

That is an awful bright lamp, maybe you could amend your post with the brand and style of 200 watt bulb you are using so an accurate comparison could be found.

200A23 is a med base bulb 23/8"  (2 7/8") diameter
200PS30 is  larger 30/8" (3 1/2") diameter.
