The reason the government picked 2012 is because that's when the world comes to an end, they know it's a stupid law too. The new bulbs suck and will only save energy if you live in a cave. If they were serious about energy usage they would outlaw appliances and power tools. Want low light with no bulbs? Put a TV or a computer in every room and leave them on. Be sensible, stock up on the old bulbs. Government regulations and 'green idiots' will be our demise.
