1923 saw Ruth hit an amazing .393 with 205 hits in only 522 at bats.  It was his only 200 plus hit season.  He also had a career high 45 doubles and walked 170 times in only 152 games.  It was also his only MVP season.

EDIT:  Thanks Aaron!  My mistake.  That's what happens when I rush to gather information.
