Hello

It can work wonders for concentration & removing the blocks you may have for success. 

A hypnosis video may not work as they are a 'one size fits all', so they may or may not work. 

The best route is to do a google search for a qualified hypnotherapist in your area, call/mail them & discuss your needs.
