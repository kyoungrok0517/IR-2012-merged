In my opinion, school uniforms are useful in developing discipline in a child. I believe children who wear their uniforms religiously won’t have problem in dressing properly in occasions and complying in their future jobs proper attire requirement.

I’ve been wearing school uniforms every day from elementary public school to Catholic high school. Our school uniforms double as our attire in inter-school competitions too and that makes us proud wearing it, and our class pictures always look decent with us having complete uniforms. However, I admit there are times I hated the monotony of school uniforms but as I’ve entered college where I can wear basically anything I want, I’ve noticed the difference. There wasn’t a single day in our fist subject class in college without the professor ranting why one of the ladies wear skimpy clothes or one of the boys having a super low pants with their boxers showing. The minutes spent by professors about proper clothing could’ve been utilized in discussing lessons. I can’t blame the professors either for bashing since such kind of improper clothes cause a lot of distraction. 

While the President’s reason of abolishing school uniform system is parent’s financial burdens, I still think that uniforms are relatively inexpensive and purchased only once or maybe twice but are good for the whole school year. And from what I’ve observed often times parents of graduating students or the graduates themselves donate their school uniform to students who have more years to go in school.
