I have really suffered from Rickets-my body can't absorb vit d-to absorb the calcium. Your bones become very soft-can't walk and your rib cage starts to bow out. So, I say whatever it takes to keep you healthy and calcium and vit d is so important and supplements keep me walking without pain-so I know they work and do their job just fine. Your being silly. Your health is at stake-can you eat goat milk cheese and goat yogurt or yogurt cheese or tofu? Green leafy vegies have some calcium-you might have to eat loads of them to get a little amount. Liquid vitamins that go right to your blood stream, I think, is better than pills that may not dissolve. Whether you take supplements or not is not the question you should be concerned with: but, keeping healthy and walking and not crippled. Do what works! and keeps you healthy. Good health to you
