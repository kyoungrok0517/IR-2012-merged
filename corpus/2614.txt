NO it's not wrong for women and children go first on the Titanic.Think about it the women were wearing Corsets that went to their thighs and long tight dresses,who could survive wearing that,not to mention most women were not active and wouldn't have the muscle to swim for long,if they could swim at all. I would hate to leave my Husband but if it was to protect my kids you bet I would. I would be proud of anyone who gave up their seat to someone who needed it.I wish more men would act like this.I don't want to be equal with men,I'm quite happy to serve my Husband.
