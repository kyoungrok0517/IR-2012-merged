I'm ALWAYS HUNGRY, m day revolves around what i'm going to eat and i eye down every hour until it finally comes to the time i can eat. my eating times are 7am, 11am, 2pm, and 4pm. I eat supper at 4 because i honestly can't go any furthur without dying of hunger. I do eat healthy regular meals so what can I do about being hungry all the time???
