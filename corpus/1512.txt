You can get bonds/stocks or what ever in another persons name easily and that would be protected yes. The Crown's saving bonds though in your name are not a good idea as they can be seized as your bankruptcy effects the tax man and he will pull them. Stocks though bought from a broker are in the brokers name even though you paid for them and they are protected, just don't declare them on your tax return. The best option you will get, is to open an off shore bank account, like on Bermuda were the creditors ability get their hands on your money is extremely hard unless you get declared a terrorist supporter. You can buy all the stocks and bonds you want through it and be extremely well protected. This is what EVERY major bank does and 90% of all people in office in a government do for that very same reason. If you go their and do it in person you'll get a nice holiday out of it too.  If you want to find out more, you can find it very easy on the internet by searching Caribbean banking.
