In Indo Gangetic plains there is a  variety of soft creeper plant of leaves similar to that of pine trees & star shaped beautiful  flowers of red, white, purple & yellow  colours of about one inch width. It is popularly called 'Ishq-e-Pechan'. Ask any Lucknow resident who is fond of gardening. Its seed is sown in the rainy season & its life is of four months. It grows very fast at the rate of eight inches per day. The whole plant looks very beautiful & makes a soft & delicate bush very fast within weeks. Can its speed of growth be increased  to thirty feet per day by any scientific method ? Horticulturists can think over it to find the way out. If found successful this can be a quick method of afforestation in arid lands & deserts.
