In short, no, you can not use an NFL helmet on a motorcycle.
NFL helmets and motorcycle helmets have completely different safety standards as they are used to prevent different types of impacts.

NFL helmets are used to prevent multiple impacts which occurat a much lower force than a motorcycle impact.  The design of an NFL helmet is to absorb and disperse the force as much as possible without damaging the materials that make up the helmet.

Motorcycle helmets are meant to prevent ONE large impact.  Because the speeds will be hire and the impact harder, say concrete vs a grass field. The impact of a motorcycle accident is larger.  To prevent the impact from damaging the head inside the helmet, it is actually designed to take all of the force.  To do this the materials inside the helmet actually compress and sometimes split.  This is a permanent process which is why one should NEVER EVER wear a helmet that has already been in an accident.  It won't save you twice.

In addition, the chinstrap of an NFL helmet would fly off the second you got hit, rendering the helmet useless.

@anti_dbz 5mph is a light jog.  Humans can run MUCH faster than that, especially when taking into account that they are running at each other.
