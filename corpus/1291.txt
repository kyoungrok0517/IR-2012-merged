after we went to their concert we bought the cd they were selling (which was from another venue) and then after we had left the casino my friend said that we could order the live recorded version of them in our town. on the back of the cd was their site but it doesnt come up, so how can i order that new cd? do i need to call the hotel? it was at the eldorado hotel and casino in reno nevada. they have been here since mid january!!!! but sadly they are leaving on the 24th of june :(
JOHN IS SOOOO FREAKING HOTT!!!!
