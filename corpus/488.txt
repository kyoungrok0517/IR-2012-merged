We are looking into buying real estate in New Jersey for under $500,000 (2+ bedrooms). We are looking for a safe neighborhood with a short commute to NYC (financial district). Also, we would prefer a neighborhood that has some sort of a trendy area with nice restaurants and hang outs. We do not currently have any children, but hope to start a family soon.
Which area in New Jersey would you recommend and why?
