My husband and I want to retire early sail on a boat the rest of our lives and really do not want to be slaves to any low paying jobs. We both have different skills. He can work on anything. I am creative and have alot of artistic skills, lots of generic talents, but nothing that has materialized into a useful career. What should I consider doing if this is our dream?
