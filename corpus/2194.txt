I tried different steroids (prednisone, decadron, hydrocortisone) for adrenal fatigue, and now Ive got an excess in my body. How can you encourage the body to remove the excess stored in the tissue, either through elimination (detox) or 'using them up'? WIll suppressing the production of all steroids assist the body in removing what is stored in the tissues?
What lies behind the eventual/gradual elimination of these toxins so that I can help my body get rid of them?
Thanks for any help.
