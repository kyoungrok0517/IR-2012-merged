I wonder how everybody convenienlty attacks Big B whatever he does professionally or personally for their own vested interest.  Raj Thankre attacked him to start campaign against north Indian, Congress attacks him to be Gujarat brand amabassador to show their secular credentials,  some talentless actor/star attacks him to become megastar, media is attacking his family just because he did not invite media to cover his son's wedding.  

Now coming to IFFA, why these organisations don't object India ties with Sri Lanka,  Cricket team playing with Sri Lanka, Sri Lankan players particiapation in IPL,  Indian cricketers going to SL for treatment and meeting their president.
