There are many really nice areas surrounding Baltimore.  Most people are questioning you because they can't imagine you wanting to move directly into the city.  Not good.  If you can afford one of the nicer nearby areas then you will probably like it.  That is having the best of both worlds, except you will still have to deal with the traffic, sorry :-(.
