Quite why anyone would want to look pale and pastey like myself is beyond me, but anyway, sunbeds can be bad for you and they can cause skin cancer, but drinking can also cause death, but drinking in moderation is acceptable, and most things in life follow this rule. If they wern't safe to use in moderation then they wouldn't be legal in the first place. Just make sure you find out just how much a safe amount for someone of your age, and skin tone would be. 

If these sunbeds cause you to double your likelihood of getting skin cancer, (Or whatever the latest statistics say) and your likelihood of getting it is 1 in 100 hundred it is only going to become 2 in 100. I'll let you do the maths for any other number!
