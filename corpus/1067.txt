Right now is a great time.  The late spring and summer are just way too hot.  You don't want any part of Baltimore then.  I don't care what is going on then.  Now the kids are back in school, the weather is in the mid 60's to mid 70's.  You can really get around and enjoy yourself.  The inner harbor attractions are not as crowded either.  The weather should be fine till the holidays.
