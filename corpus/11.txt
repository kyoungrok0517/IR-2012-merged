I am interested in breeding savannah cats....I do not however want to get a Several cat to do so. So I am wondering, if I was to breed a Savannah with a Bengal, would they produce Savannahs? I did read some on how they're mostly bread with house cats like Bengals or Egyptian maus. Can someone with some knowledge and experience possibly answer this for me?
