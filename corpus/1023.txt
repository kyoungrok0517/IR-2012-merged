Many Royal Caribbean ships have glass elevators but Explorer is in the earlier class of ships, the Voyager class, which may not have them.  The Radiance class ships like Serenade of the Seas, do have "9 passenger elevators (6 of which are glass and either look over the Centrum atrium or outside the ship through a glass wall)."
