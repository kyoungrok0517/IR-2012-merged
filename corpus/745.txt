How do you feel about the incandescent light bulbs being banned in the us by 2012. I have several compact florescent bulbs in my lamps that are shaped like incandesents, and I love them, but there are some fixtures that require incandescent bulbs in my house and it would be too costly to replace the fixtures over a bulb, plus walk in closets a compact florescent would not work, because you would have to wait for it to warm up so you can see your clothes.
