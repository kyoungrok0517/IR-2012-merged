i think what the manager should do is try to talk to the employee about the situation. let her know what's happening and give her a warning. if the problem persists, the manager has every right to fire her. the manager let her know how her attitude was affecting everyone and even gave her a warning. if however she does sue, then she's had a problem with her from the beginning.
