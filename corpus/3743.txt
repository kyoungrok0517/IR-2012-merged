You can do this on your own. I am almost 42 yrs. old, and waiting for my divorce to finalize.  I eat good every day and I exercise 6 days a week.  The activity helps me to reduce stress.  Getting my body in good shape gives me the confidence to find a man who interests me, not one that is willing to date me.  There is a difference.  You want to find a guy who you are attracted to, not someone who is willing to date you.  Start working on yourself today.  Just decide to eat healthy and exercise and see what happens?
