When you withdraw your money, some of it is withheld and sent in for income taxes.  Then, when you file your taxes, if the amount withheld is not enough to pay the taxes you owe, you will owe additional tax.  If the amount withheld is more than the tax, you will a refund of the difference.

So you are not taxed twice, you just might be paying it in two payments.
