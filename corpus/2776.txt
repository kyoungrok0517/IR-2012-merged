I just saw a documentary about this. The plague virus is a living organism and it needs a host to feed on.  There wasn't anyway to stop the spread of plague as long as there were a lot of people around, but once the majority of people were dead, the virus couldn't survive and just sort of fizzled out. It wasn't eradicated, so when the population grew again there were new outbreaks.
