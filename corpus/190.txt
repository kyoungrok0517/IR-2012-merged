If you start dating someone, only one of two things can happen.  One:   He will say yes and you will both go on a date and have a good time.  Two:  He will thank you be say no, and probably give you a reason for 'no'. And not matter which answer you get, the world will not explode, the sky will not fall, and everything will be fine.  Except the guy that says no will be sorry for not being able to know you.  Good Luck and have a great new year.
