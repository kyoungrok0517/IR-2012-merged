As with any loan, when you sell your house you pay off the loan with the proceeds of the sale and you get to keep whatever is left over.  If (as happens a bit these days) the loan is more than the proceeds then you either have to pay the difference out of your own pocket, or get the bank to agree to waive the difference which they hate to do (as in a short sale).  FHA is no different from other loans in this regard.
