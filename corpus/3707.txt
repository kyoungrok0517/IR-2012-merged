I read a great book a while ago, about a psychologist (psychotherapist?) following his story and a number of his cases. The psychologist empathises with one of his patients who suffers depression, although he doesn't seek help for depression for himself, and ends up killing himself. 
I'd love to read the book again, but I can't remember the title or author, any help would be appreciated.
