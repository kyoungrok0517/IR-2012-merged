the whole reason school boards try to enforce school uniforms is because they think it will stop bullying or in my schools case prevent more law suits but school uniforms dont stop bullying if anything it helps it such as goths or emos who wear uniforms its not right it doesnt go with there style and prissy popular kids all they do is bend the rule and hike up the skirts or tighten the shirts till the teachers say something basically what im trying to say is school uniforms dont change bullying in fact it  helps it
