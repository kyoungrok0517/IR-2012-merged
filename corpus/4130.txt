Again for the billionth time.....
There wasn't just one big bang.
There were billions of them
Our universe is the result of one of them that worked. 
The universe contains billions of proto stars,
The ones that work out become stars
the universe has billions of stars.
The ones that form a certain way have planets
There are billions of planets orbiting billions of stars.
the ones that form a certain way at the right distance from their star become earth-like planets 
There are billions of  earth-like planets the ones that have the right elements have life evolve on them. 
There are billions of life sustaining planets the ones with the right balance of conditions evolve intelligent life that wonders about stuff like this. 
If all the conditions fail to come to together at any point along the way :
Bang too big or not big enough 
proto stars too dispersed 
Planets too big small hot cold far away from or too close to sun
The right primordial slop never forms or contains a fatal flaw or forms in the wrong place or gets zapped by lava or....
The environment is too lush to challenge the life forms to evolve or too sparse to sustain life for long enough. Or one of many inevitable mass extinctions went all the way and wiped  everything out. 
then those places cease to exist or fall by the way side
In a nearly infinite multiverse over a nearly infinite amount of time not only is almost anything possible but most likely happens over and over and over. IMVHO that ongoing multilevel eternal process is God.
