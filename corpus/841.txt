OK, there's this hickory nut tree that I went to the fall before last, and I collected a bunch of nuts.  Then, this year, it was smothered in mistletoe (way more than the year before) and there weren't any nuts.

Do hickory trees have nuts every year?  Does the excess mistletoe sap the tree's strength, or is it just a sign that the tree is weak in general?  Or does the mistletoe have nothing to do with the nut yield?  (Other hickory nut trees had nuts last year, about as many as the year before.)
