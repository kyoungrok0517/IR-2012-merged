I'm a mum and as a parent you try to put your kids first.Maybe her little girl isn't along side her but as a mum trying to fight for her and trying to show the world she is still being an mum and not forgetting her is the thing that a mum or dad would do.I know everyone is divided on the McCanns but as parents imagine the pain and then have half the world attacking your every move.Those that have routed for them if new evidence proves them wrong just need to say I was too fair towards them.Those though that have constantly attacked them while they are searching for their lost child will have to think about the added pain they caused them.Don't forget the media are very good at highlighting what they want known who's to say Kate hasn't seen a psychiatrist
