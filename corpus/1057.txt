I lived in Baltimore last year, and it would depend on which University you are planning to attend.  
Are you going to attend the John Hopkins University?  If so which campus?  There are quite a few nice areas to live in even within the city limits.  You do not want to be too much in the "burbs" the traffic is terrible, better to be close to their subway system if you do not have a car.  I enjoyed it in Baltimore, I had a Large studio with no kitchen, but it came with a micro-wave and a refrigerator, and I was across the street from the university, and plenty of shopping around and it was trendy student neighborhood, and residential. I paid  $530. per month including electricity, which was not bad if you watch your usage.  But I'll warn you they do ask for 1-2 months security deposit. Pretty safe as well security all around the area at all hours of the night. It does have a large art culture, and is a "cozy" city. In many ways it reminded me of Montreal, which is where I now reside.
Please do not hesitate to ask me more.
