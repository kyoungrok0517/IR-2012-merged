There are no scientific facts or events that will make the world end in 2012.

The stuff about "supervolcanoes" is completely unfounded - even the USGS says there is no reason to expect Yellowstone to erupt in the near future.

Our magnetic poles have switched in the past, but it takes thousands of years of steadily decreasing magnetic field strength to happen.  If the field continues to decrease in strength at its present rate it could collapse and switch ---- in AD 3000 (not 2012).

There is no reason or way for the world to blow up.

The other "predictions" are just as ridiculous.
