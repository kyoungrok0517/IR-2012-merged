I work for a dermatologist and she always trys to get her patients to stop tanning.  Tanning in any form damages the skin, and makes you at higher risk for getting skin cancer later in life.  It also ages you prematurely, so if you don't tan now you won't look like a Sharpei puppy by the time you're 40.  You might think about getting a spray-on tan right before you go on vacation so at least you won't look too "white".   Then when you're on vacation use lots and lots of sunscreen.
