hi--ive got one son who is 18 that has Autism..ive got a 2 1/2 year old with delays and sensory issues and no speech but he hasn't been diagnosed yet..I think they give way to many shots together and at a young age...these need to be spaced out more as they get older  i think...i do think there is reason to fear vaccinations and the link to autism..i think some kids are more prone to get it because of something inside their genes and in the shots both.with everything going on in the world its a scary place and vaccinations are good to keep away some serious diseases i do believe that...
