Once Nagumo realized the US Carriers were not in Pearl Harbor he had no idea where they really were.  The idea that they might be ferrying Marine Aircraft to Wake and Midway never occurred to anybody. As far as he was concerned they could have been sneaking up on him at that very moment with most of his own aircraft either out of fuel and struck below or still over Pearl Harbor. He also had a fixed amount of fuel for his ships to pursue them and a long way to go to get back to base.  Also Nagumo was a battleship man by experience and training.  He really didn't have the decisiveness of a true carrier admiral. Bull Halsey he was not. So he decided the smart move was to recover his aircraft and return to Japanese waters post haste
