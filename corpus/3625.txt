I only used a tanning bed before big school dances and spring vacations. I've had one spot of cancer that needed to be cut off of my arm, and I have to go back to have two more taken off of my back. Not only does the procedure to have those spots removed  hurt, it's not pleasant to look at. For a mole the size of a pencil eraser, I now have a scar bigger than a quarter. I also had stitches for three weeks that bled and made it so that I couldn't wear short sleeves in public for fear of scaring people.

Is a little tan worth that to you? If you're burning in the sun, there's a good chance you would do the same in a tanning bed and should make your peace with pale skin.
