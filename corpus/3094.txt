Water vapor in the atmosphere actually causes any sample of air to weigh LESS than a "dry" sample of equivalent size. 

Also, when you have rain storms, you need upward motion to get clouds to form. Sinking air (akin to high pressure) will inhibit cloud formation.

As air rises it cools and condenses (we call it adiabatic lapse rate). The rising air creates low pressure at the surface and high pressure in the upper levels as it rushes upward and then expands outward from the origin.
