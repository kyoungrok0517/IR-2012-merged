Ok. I'm 18 I've been with my boyfriend since I was 13.. We broke up about 7 months ago. I'm from the dc area. I know my statistics... We are the highest in the country for HIV/AIDS and all STDs. Especially in my age group. And yes sadly teen girls. Back to the story... We broke up, I thought this was the big one.  He had his fun with I guess you can say the easy girls of this area. Of course he swears he's used protection... (I'd be a fool to just believe everything he said). Now this is where I need you guys to come in... I need back up in showing I'm right for making this decision. I'm having sex I should do it responsibly. My rules were NO SEX until he gets tested with me present in the room. I'll even do it too. Now, am I wrong or over board for this? I don't think so but he does. I'm looking out for me. Somethings even condoms not save. I like being healthy, and I'm absolutely afraid of pleasure bringing me a life time of pain that can be avoided! Tell him I'm making a conscious decision! We are living right here in dc in the belly of the beast... And you wanna go and sleep around, then come back? And expect to possibly harm my health? Do u have anyone agreeing with me.
