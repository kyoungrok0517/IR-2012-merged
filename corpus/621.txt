only one way to find out
most animals do not see colors. so i think this should def work out well in the camo!!
keep a safe distance. 

a tip: if comething does goes wrong. have a friend in camo somewhere far from u watching your safety and maybe have a small cooler with raw meat in case something happen your friend can rediect the deer towards the food. then run!!
