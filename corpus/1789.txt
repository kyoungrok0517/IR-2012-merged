what ever you decide , the wieght can be changed, usually there is a weight bolt in the butt for this reason, you might like a heaver cue today and a lighter cue in a month, so they made the cue to be able to adjust the weight with out buying a new cue everytime. the bolst are easy to change ,but I would recomend getting some one that knows what they are doing so you dont ruin or scuff the butt
