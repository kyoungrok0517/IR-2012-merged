She was in this movie where she was girlfriend of this guy who this girl was obssesed with. The girl killed Jennifer Aniston so she could stay with the guy, and she ends up killing the guy's friend too. Can anybody tell me what movie it is? P.S. Jennifer Aniston was killed by getting choked with a wire or something?
