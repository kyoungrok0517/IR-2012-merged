The allure is in the spices and flavors of the food.  I love mexican food(authentic) and sometimes even texmex, but I prefer my own cooking.  I was married to a mexican for 17 years and learned a lot about the cuisine.  However, no matter how "authentic" it is, it still doesnt match the flavor of the food prepared with fresh ingredients from mexico.  During my visits to mexico and preparing the same meals I do here, it still taste better using the fresh meats and veggies from mexico.  Meal time is definitely leisure there and full of chatter.
