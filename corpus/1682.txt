You are allowed to mention things in pop culture. 

Fair use is not just mentioning titles and products, it's using part of a writer's work, such as printing out a page in a book to distribute for a lesson in a classroom, or taking a quote to use in your thesis. 

Check the Writer's Digest website, I think they have some info on legal issues like that.
