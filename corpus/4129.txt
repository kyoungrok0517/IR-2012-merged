Wine. Jesus would rather have drunk wine rather than water. That is why he turned water into wine by the barrel. Jesus was made in Gods image, and Man was made in the image of God, which means we all have the same potential for alcoholism. So a nice Cabernet volcano would work for me thank you God!
