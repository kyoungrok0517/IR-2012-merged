Above Ground Pool.  I am having a get together this weekend.  The temp is going to drop into the mid 60's.  I hate to deal with the plastic solar covers (and I don't think they work all that well).  I would consider a black tube solar heating system but don't know how effective they are.  Are there any chemicals that will do it?  What about the solar fish that leaks os Isopropyl Alcohol?  I don't want to spend a ton...as I hope to get a heater next season
