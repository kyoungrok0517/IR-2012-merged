Who can tell me a fun way to make Halloween treats?

I know google and ask and foodnetwork already, so don't tell me those!

Who has a recipe that they can acually put on a notecard? Right now?

It would be a plus if you could shape them into cool hapes with cookie cutters! If you can shape them, where can you find them? How much money?
