I recommend finding a reputable dealer through the Billiard Congress of America site. www.bca-pool.com     Many internet sites are good, but there are unfortunately a lot of scams out there.  Itâ€™s best to go into a store so that you can actually see what you are getting instead of only seeing pictures.
