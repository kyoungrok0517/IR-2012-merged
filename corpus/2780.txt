to the best of my knowledge the plague is caused by the flea in the sewage rodent they are the cause of spreading the illness. Just like mosquito (female) are the cause of dengue that can kill you the rodent were killed and those ill were burn or seal in their coffin.  If not cared for the plague can still return to this age so just be careful at all time.
