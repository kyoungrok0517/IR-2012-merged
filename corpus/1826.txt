I would suggest  you purchase a McDermott cue. You can get one of their decent sticks for under $100.00. The shafts of cues are "basically" the same. The price goes up when you start getting into the fancier butts and you can easily spend upwards of $1,000.00 for an ornate cue. Contact you local pool hall and most of them will either carry McDermott cues or they can order you one. I can order it for you if you live in Florida. I can order most any cue for you for that matter.
