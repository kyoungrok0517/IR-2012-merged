I stopped watching CNN long ago. Their coverage of the election showed them to be the propaganda arm of the extreme left wing of the Democrats. 

I'm sure that CNN never mentions the fact that Gaza was occupied by the Israeli army until just a few years ago.

In 2005 Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza and the West Bank, forcibly removing Jewish settlements in hopes of advancing the road way to peace and the two state solution.

Instead of establishing an independant palestinian state the Arabs in Gaza spent the last three years turning their land into an Iranian sponsored missile base.

This is entirely the fault of Hamas and Iran
