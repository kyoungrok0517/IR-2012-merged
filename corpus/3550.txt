You're a good Mama to make bread for your family!



Here is a little article that I found on why babies shouldn't eat honey.  I always like to know the 'why's so that I can base my decisions on facts.

I would also be curious to know if this were a valid concern for a breastfed baby, as baby should be getting Mama's immune system.  But better to be safe than sorry.

It's true that babies don't 'need' any other food than breastmilk for the first year, but between 5 and 7 months, babies usually start getting curious and interested in food and eating, and get really serious about gnawing on stuff with teething.  There is no harm in letting baby experiment with some basic foods.  Cold celery sticks were my favorite 'teething' treat for my babies, as the strings hold it together well.

You may want to play around with the option of using Xylitol and making some homemade teething bisciuts.  Xylitol is a sugar alcohol, which has been used in Finland for years to promote tooth and gum health.  It does this by neutralizing the acidity in the mouth so that harmful bacteria are suppressed.  Most other sweetners help the bacterias flourish as they create an acidic environment and 'feed' the bacteria.  Xylitol is available in health food stores.
