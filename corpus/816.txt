It spreads from birds eating the seeds, and passing them on  through thier poop onto other trees.  There is no efficient way to prevent its appearance.

The berries form in the winter, and can be an important food source for birds.  It also does not kill trees very quickly, and often a healthy tree will outlive the mistletoe infection.

You can prune off completely the affected branches.  If you remove the mistletoe itself, it will merely sprout back.  However, doing that will still prevent it from flowering and seeded and therefore reproducing if you do it regularly.   

If your tree is healthy, and you enjoy the bird-watching, I would just enjoy the birds in the winter, maybe harvest some mistletoe for decoration at christmastime (keeping in mind that the berries are poisonous to people and cats), prune and remove if the mistletoe population gets overly vigorous, but otherwise, not fret too much about it.
