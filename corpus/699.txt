yes they can but you need to be careful since the male is the larger. It's usually the male that determines the size of pups and are you ready for the c-section. Also you may want to check into the laws as far as possibly getiing rid of the pus at 8 weeks old.
Also to breed correctly ends up costing as pups should have at least their first shots and wormings done plus the extra food. not to mention if there is an emergency c-section so please really consider what you might be getting into
