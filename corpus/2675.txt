Did I get it right that she is not certain yet whether or not she is pregnant - you find out next week?  Time for a pregancy test from any drug store to find out what you are dealing with.  All this drama with no test yet?   Suspicious.  You might want to examine your relationship with her.

Get her to do a home pregnancy test. RIGHT NOW.  If it's positive, go with her to a family member to talk it out. 

Either way, she should see her doctor about birth control.
