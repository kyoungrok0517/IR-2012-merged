Hey, first of all, quit being so tough on  yourself!! Second, we all hit bottom sometimes and that is ok, but you do have to be determined to pick yourself back up! I have been there. I started writing out my goals and working every day to reach them. Pretty soom you will look back and not be able to see where you started because you have come so far. Take it one day at a time and make the best of every day. Try to slow down and see what is really around you. The Lord has a plan for all of us and you will recognize yours soon. Just dont be so burried in self doubt and misery that you dont see it right in front of you.
