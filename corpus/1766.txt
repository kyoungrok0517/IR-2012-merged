i have seen a few people with it done. i personally don't like it, it looks too neat. maybe what i've seen was done a few years ago and it looks better now? 
I won't say don't let it bother you, cos it obviously does. but if it makes you feel better, i have a friend who loves bald men, i'm sure lots of women do too. :)
