The snowman is 7 1/2 " high, wooden, and German made. It is NOT the miniature bavarian snowman nutcracker. It is wearing a green hat with a feather, a chain with three medals across the lowest ball, and a red pretzel necklace. A red scarf is wrapped around the neck and a pipe extends from the mouth. In one hand is a beer stein with initials, possibly HB.
