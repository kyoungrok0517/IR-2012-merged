Simple question here.  Has Rutgers accepted you?  Have they already made you an offer for the scholarship?

Here is the deal - from someone that knows a little about college.  Most schools will give you the scholarship funds upfront.  And, I think they know that some kids will goof-off a little in their senior year of high school and sort of let their grades go down hill.  Again, they know and accept that.

So...they will let you start your freshman year at Rutgers with your promised $8,000 a year in scholarship funds.  BUT, if you screw-up your GPA in college, then they will take the FUTURE years' scholarship money away.  I know, because this happened to me.  I only received a meager $500 a semester in scholarship money, and I kept it until my GPA went from a 3.80 to a 1.80.  Then the scholarship money went away.

So, go ahead and go to Rutgers my friend.  But, you'd better damn well focus on your studies if you want that scholarship money to pay at least part of your way through school.
