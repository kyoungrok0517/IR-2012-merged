You're likely to get specific answers by doing a search on "minerals earth crust".  Basically the earth's common elements are the materials composing the mantle (to which the first respondent correctly referred).  The most common of those minerals is silica, the mineral in volcanic glass (obsidian) and quartz.  Silicates, which are combinations of silicon and oxygen, combined in different ways with other elements, comprise most other minerals in the crust.  99% of the earth's crust is composed of just 8 elements, including those two and iron, sodium, potassium, magnesium, aluminum and calcium.  Obviously there are others as well and the more prevalent of the minor elements are metals, such as copper, gold, silver, manganese, titanium, etc.  If you'll look at the periodic table, you'll see that all of these except those first two I mentioned (oxygen and silicon) are metals, although calcium, potassium and magnesium are alkali metals, but that's no real mystery, as most of the periodic table is made of metals of one type or other.
