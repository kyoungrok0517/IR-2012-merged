My father had a heart attack week before last.Day after tomw he is undergoing Angiogram to know what is the condition of his heart.He wants to go on with medicine after that.He is willing to do regular exercise,proper dieting and also keep a healthy mind.He doesn't want to do an angioplast or a surgery.
Any of you have any experiences ? Any possible suggestions ?
He used to have some mental tensions for some time.But now he is free from all that.
Any advices ?
