You need to have your dog checked by a qualified veterinarian who can examine your dog and come up with a diagnosis.  It can be as simple as a food allergy or as serious as a thyroid condition.  You don't want to wait long on things like this as this could very well be an early sign of a serious condition that can be resolved easily if caught soon enough.
