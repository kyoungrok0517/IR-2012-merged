Hi...if you are serious about safely fasting, try reading "The Miracle of Fasting" by Bragg. Also, www.curezone.com is an awesome site with fasting support forums (read the FAQs before posting there). 

In my experience, the best fasts are pure water only (distilled water - nothing else). Sometimes I add a bit of lemon to the water just to make it more palatable. As far as what you can drink, I think that would depend on the reason for which you are doing this fast. Some people fast for healing purposes and detox. If that is you, then you would want to stick with pure water, to let the body's digestive system slow/stop so that energy can be diverted to healing. Some people fast purely for weight loss, and seem to have better luck and stick with it with juice (or diluted juice/water). 

One thing you would want to avoid are diet drinks and coffee...it really defeats the purpose of any fast...think about it this way: if your body is trying to eliminate caffeine and artificial preservatives through detox, what sense does it make to introduce more of them through drinks that contain them? I am a fan of the pure water...be warned though: your body eliminates lots of toxins while fasting, and it can actually be quite alarming (weird pains, upset stomach, headaches, etc.) Good luck with your research and your fast if you choose to do it!
