Nope, the BMI is just a ratio of weight to height.  So it's not accurate and can't tell the difference between muscle and fat.  I've heard a better method is to go to a doctor and get them to actually measure the body fat with a special tool.  But you are probably quite thin anyways, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.
