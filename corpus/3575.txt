It's got to that point in winter where I'm just pale and unhealthy looking, I miss having some colour in my skin. I know the harmful effects of tanning, but I know that a small amount of sun can also do you good. Is there any amount of sun bed use that's not too harmful but will give you a slight glow? Something as brief as 5 or 10 minutes a week? I have slightly olive skin by the way.
