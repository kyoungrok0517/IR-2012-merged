Always.

With the exception of working (sheep/farm/guard) dogs, no dogs should ever be left outside on a regular basis, especially not at night, especially not in extreme temperatures.

Your poor little Dachsi/Beagle mutt is NOT equipped to spend its life outside in cold weather.  Hasn't the right coat for any temperatures below 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

And, more important than its coat, your dog doesn't have the temperament to be shut away from its family day & night.  If you can't keep your dog inside, you need to find another home for it -- A family that really will treasure that little doggie, and give it a warm place inside to sleep, near its family.

Then, please, don't ever get another dog.  It sounds like a dog is an inconvenience for your family, so you'd really be happier without one.
