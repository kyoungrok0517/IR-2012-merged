Officers can retire after their initial contract is up (which is about the same time as an enlistment). Officers can stay about as long as they like if they are senior enough where as enlisted start getting denied reenlist at around 20-22 years unless they are way up there (in which case they can stay till around 30 years). After you retire with a career spent in the military, you can get an excellent job on top of having a retirment, savigns, and a TSP from the military.
