A lawyer will not be helping you.

This is NOT a lemon law case.  Used car, too bad.

I guess you have a Dodge Durango to sell on Craigslist for parts only.

The seller probably did even less work than you did (yeah, that's saying something) in buying this vehicle from an auction and putting it up for sale--it's not illegal for them to not know everything about a vehicle.  The problem is...you bought it anyway!

Good luck with your vehicle.  Bad enough it is a Chrysler product.
