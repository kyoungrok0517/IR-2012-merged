I've always thought of cues being for both men and women.  If you look at the top women players in the world, you will find out that they play with the same brand that men do, with a few exceptions.  You should try out several cues and pick the one that you're most comfortable with.  Just because a cue manufacturer makes models targeted for women players, and endorsed by professional women players, it doesn't mean women will perform better with, say, a hot-pink cue.  I suggest choosing the cue that you play best with, most custom cues do not appear to look either masculine or feminine.
