Simply stated, you are not being double taxed on your money regardless of how you invest it.

Read below for brief explanations:

Traditional IRA's and 401(k).  Your taxable income is reduced when you make contributions.  When you withdraw the money, then tax is collected as ordinary income.

Roth IRA's and Roth 401(k)'s.  You don't get a deduction when you make contributions.  When you withdraw the money, there is no tax collected.

Any other investment.  You don't get a deduction when you make the investment.  When you withdraw the money, only the earnings (interest and realized capital gains) are taxed.  The earnings are money that you never had before.

Hope this helps explain things.
