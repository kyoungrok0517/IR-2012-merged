As an aspiring adventurer/mountaineer, I looked up to him in many ways, it is indeed sad news to hear of his passing.

Though a few years back I found a book titled "High Adventure" written by Hillary after climbing Everest. (complete with the first summit photos ever taken) 

I think he is an inspiration and a true legend, for alot of people worldwide.

RIP
