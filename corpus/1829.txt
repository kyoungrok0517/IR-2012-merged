I just wanted to disagree with those saying to buy a cheapo Walmart cue. Most of those will fall apart rather quickly (trust me, I owned my fair share of them growing up) and will not play the same as a well made cue. Do yourself a favor and spend $100-150 on a decent cue you could use you the next 20 years if you really wanted to.
