No No No No No that is so wrong. . . you can ask my dad he's turning 59 the day before halloween and he goes all out. He decorates the house and i don't mean just a few things i mean he has a couple hundred feet of lights 4 spiders that move bout 20 tombstones huge homemade spider web of rope and spider made out of wood  a haunted house made out of wood painted body parts all over the yard Frankenstein Bride of Frankenstein wolf man huge alien  all about 7 feet tall then some witches  fog machines fog bubble machine things flying around halloween music playing he went all the way each year he buys about 200 dollars worth of halloween stuff and keeps adding we have the best house in the city and they tried so many times to put us on the news live or in the newspaper but we don't let them since we already get over 1000 kids easily.... so my dad has a popcorn machine and uses that instead of candy and since we're well known the parents trust use and lets their kids get some also my dad dress up too he goes nuts over it and my neighbor that are close to 50 go to a halloween party for ADULTS each year and last year my dad made one of them a tin man costume out of metal and each year they have a best costume trophy my neighbor won it with the tin man and they guy that has won for the past 10 years finally lost but halloween is for both the kids and the adults to have fun be yourself scare people get scared and more if not they wouldn't have things like spooky world halloween is for all age no matter how old you get and even if they say its childish say your always a kid at heart and we all are so forget what their saying have fun i know my dad will and neighbors
