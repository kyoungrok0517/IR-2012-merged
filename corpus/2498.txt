Of course decorate ur house! if u can...have the party outside! so that part of the party can be in the dark! Tell everyone to dress in their costume! Have a prize for the best costume! let ur parents pick- if they're gonna be there! play scary music on a boom box. play the bobbing for apples! Have snacks n' stuff...

and another cute idea that someone made at a halloween campfire was this...
they took a nutter butter (cookie) and dipped it in white chocolate then they took chocolate chips and put them side by side...so it looks like a ghost!
You'll also need wax paper to put the cookies that have been dipped in the chocolate on.

Fun game...
get a partner and a roll of toilet paper. Line up and one of the partners wraps their partner up in the toilet paper...once wrapped with the toilet paper...the "mummy" has to make it to the finish line...(u decide what the finish line's gonna be) 
Dont forget to recycle!

You can have a scavender hunt around ur house when it gets dark too! Hide like fake arms, legs, fingers, ect...and pick a partner to find the items!


Happy Halloween!
