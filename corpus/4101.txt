The subduction zone is just one plate being driven/pushed/or pulled under another plate, in most cases, continental-oceanic convergent boundaries.

There are three main types of volcanoes
    Stratovolcano (Composite)
    Shield Volcano
    Cinder Cones

Shield volcanos are typically not made from subduction boundaries.  They are produced by less volatile magma which means no big eruption.  Composite or Stratovolcanos are the eruptive type that occur around the subduction boundaries.

The volcanos made all depend on the type of magma present.
