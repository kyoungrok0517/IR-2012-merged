Nothing will happen. The whole thing is an invention by a bunch of frauds and crackpots trying to get you to buy worthless books and videos. None of it has any basis in real science. The people promoting this have no knowledge of science. They just like to pretend to be knowledgeable in order to impress the gullible. Don't be one of the gullible.
There is no 'ancient prediction' by the Mayans or anyone else. These were all invented in the last 20 years.
There is no 'mystery planet' about to pass by. Why don't the fraudsters tell us its current location in the sky, so we can all look at it? You decide.
There will be no rare alignment, either planetary or galactic. When was the last alignment that caused us any problems anyway?
There will be no pole shift. A magnetic pole shift is not imminent and probably tens of thousands of years away. A sudden rotational pole shift is a physical impossibility.
The next solar maximum is expected in mid 2013, not 2012 and is expected to be less intense than the last maximum in 2001.
Other predictions such as the photon belt and Terence McKenna's Timewave Zero are just too silly to bother with.
