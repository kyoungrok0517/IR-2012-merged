As many of the other posts have already suggested building a pond, I will just say that if you build it, the frogs will come!  
     As for finding or purchasing frogs, let me give you a link about why you should introduce ONLY native species of frogs to whatever habitat you create.  Here is a brief exerpt from this info...

From Geoff Johnson-Iowa   "As someone who has to do a frog census several times a year, I would like to make a few comments. First, frogs will find the water. I live a mile from the nearest body of water, and if you know how to find them, you can find toads and grey treefrogs if you spend a lot of time looking here. 
Also, do NOT release purchased frogs or tadpoles. I can state several reasons why not to. First of all, the majority of tadpoles sold in pet stores are bullfrog tadpoles. I have seen bullfrogs wipe out entire frog populations in isolated areas. Cricket frogs, chorus frogs, tree frogs, even leopard frogs just vanish. Amphibians are on the decline, and releasing amphibians which eat other amphibians is not a good idea. 

The other issue is of course parasites. Numerous species of frogs and toads have become extinct in part to, or completely due to a skin parasite which has spread almost entirely across the globe on imported frogs."

     If you aren't sure what species of frogs are native to your area, just look up your county extension office (usually connected to 4-h and master gardeners) or call your local zoo.  
     In regards to building a pond, or providing a water source, google words related to the subject.  LOTS of folks have provided step by step instructions with pictues on very small to very large water sources.  Most of these folks have also done these projects on the cheap- creating their own filtration systems out of common materials for next to nothing!  

Good luck with your project-
