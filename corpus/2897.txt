FLINT< MICHIGAN.

a city with a mayor who publicallyt cusses people out. 
(its true, lol)

One of America's classic Rust Belt cities, located in Eastern Michigan and north of Detroit. It has lost more jobs and more people than most other cities except for nearby Detroit. It was once home to Buick and called "Buick City," but those were the days. The city of Flint now has just one auto plant left. The loss of jobs and people has made Flint one of the most dangerous cities in the country, except for Detroit again. 


wow! i am proud!
