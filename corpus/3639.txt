Yes you can get an FHA loan on a manufactured home but you will need a 20% down payment, at least in California.  Plus the seller will have to provide a cert for the manufactured home stating it is attached to a concrete foundation.  

When you say double-wide it usually means a mobile home.  By definition, a mobile home is one with wheels, unless the wheels are removed and set on piers.  A mobile home is also usually thought of as being in a park where the land is not owned. A mobile home is not considered real estate and will needs to be registered and licensed by the Department of Motor Vehicles or Bureau of Motor Vehicles.

A manufactured home on the other hand, is made in a factory, and taken from the factory by truck in two pieces to where it will be put together and set on a foundation.
