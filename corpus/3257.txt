I really learned a lot from the hypnosis downloads free online course.  You do have to sign up for a newsletter with your email address but hey at least its free.  It will teach you a lot about how real hypnosis works.  You can get the free training course at:  http://hypnosisdownloads.com/learn_hypnosis.html?2323

I also found their subscription download service to be useful once I had learned a bit about how hypnosis works and knew that I was interested in utilizing it as a tool to try to beat some habits that I have.

Hope this helps,
Joshua
