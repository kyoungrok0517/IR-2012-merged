The better question is when.  Mohammad thought the world would have ended by now. He thought the entire lifespan of the world was six thousand years, and that he was in the year 5600.  

The early Christians thought the end of the world was within their lifetimes. Paul prophesied as much, as did John of Patmos, and Jesus supposedly did to, if the gospels written decades after his execution can be trusted as an accurate portrayal of what he said.
