I think I might have just answered your question just a second ago on another question you posted.  You do not want to put them all together.  The turtle needs it own home.  The snails, guppies and frogs will live happily together until the frogs are big enough to eat the guppies for dinner.  I have a yahoo group on african clawed frogs if you would like to join and read about their care I will post it at the end of this.  They make really great pets and you can even teach them to come up to the top of the water and hand feed them.  When little they will eat hbh frog and tadpole bites along with small pieces of frozen krill, reptomin floating sticks and also small pieces of earthworms.  If you are thinking about getting a african dwarf frog be really careful where you buy them as there is a fungus going thru the dwarf frogs that kills them pretty quickly.  I had 5 of them and they all died within 1 month of having them.  I have 11 adult african clawed frogs which get bigger and 3 froglets from raising some of the adults tadpoles.  They are really cool pets.  If you are the one talking about using a 20 gal. tank you could have 2 acfs in that tank along with a couple snails.  You would need a filter for a 40 gal tank as they can be messing and you need to over filter.  Anyway here is my site if you would like to join and read about them.
