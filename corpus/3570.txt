No they are definately not safe at all, they emit UV rays which are much harsher than the sun and from the first time on one you can increase your risk on skin cancer from up to 50%

I dont wanna sound like an annoying adult or anything telling u nonono, but i am always tempted to go one cos i see people i know who go on them and they look a nice brown colour but seriously when they're old their skin will be really aged, wrinkly, age/liver spots, and will loook much older than they are

Also its really bad if ur pale in general as ur more likely to develop moles and cancerous ones even if u wear sun cream etc

usually in the uk anyway theyr about 50p a minute and at first u go on for like 3 mins then gradually build up but i wouldn't advise it at all

next time it's sunny just put on some tanning oil and sit out for an hour or two but come inside or just stick to fake tans like St Tropez or Fake Bake that give a natural brown colour and even St Moriz fake tan, its really cheap too but contains the st tropez tanning ingredients but comes out a lovely colour :)
