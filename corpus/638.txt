Once a deer has been killed, rigor mortis (stiffening of the muscles) quickly sets in, and lasts for up to 24 hours. Once rigor mortis ends, enzymes naturally contained within the meat begin to break down collagen -- a tough substance that binds muscle cells together. As the collagen breaks down, the meat becomes more tender. Older deer have more collagen in their muscles, and should be aged for a longer period of time than young deer.
