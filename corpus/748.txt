I don't like them, they're too dim. I'm blind in one eye and need as much light as I can get.
 Just a reminder: All light fixtures have a sticker on them stating the maximum wattage bulb that may be used. You should NEVER use a higher wattage bulb, a fixture can only dissipate so much heat at a time.
And it could cause real problems. For example:Say there was a house fire, the fire inspector determines that it was caused by a light fixture that was rated for a 40 watt bulb but had a 100 watt light bulb installed. An Insurance company COULD call that "negligence" and lessen or possibly deny a claim.
  ***Insurance people? Could this happen?***
