Find her a pregnancy crisis center or Planned Parenthood, they will help her with any decision she makes be it raising the child or adoption. AND they will help her tell her parents if she has not already.

Her parents do need to know & she needs to be safe about this from the beginning w/ prenatal care & taking care of herself.

When she hits anywhere from 3-7 mos(depending on her size) her parents WILL know...it's best to get it out of the way. Maybe a friend could do it w/ her (you?) or a trusted relative?

She can get a PG test at the dollar store.
