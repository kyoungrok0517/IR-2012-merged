1. I think that they appreciate conditions which are slightly acidic (like rainwater) so a pH of around 6-6.5 would be ideal. 
2. They prefer tropical temperatures of around 25 degrees Celsius, and not going below 15 degrees C.
3. Fairly low, since they aren't particularly salt tolerant.
4. It shouldn't matter too much, since they are epiphytes and should be grown in a very light and airy medium, such as in chips of bark. This ensures that plenty of oxygen gets to the roots.

As long as you grow them in a suitably airy medium and water with mainly rainwater, then they will grow well. They also prefer to be kept in relatively humid conditions.
