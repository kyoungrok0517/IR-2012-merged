My new boyfriend bought this orchid plant, (is that what it's called?) It has flowers but is potted in a pot he said the florist said they were low maintenance, it's really beautiful, and I'd hate for it to die, I am terrible when it comes to plants. What should I do with it, how can I keep it alive?
