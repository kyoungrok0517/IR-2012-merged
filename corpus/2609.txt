I think your view is perfectly normal.  I agree with it. I agree that should be the rule in general.
I also agree with Goose who stated she would most likely not be able to leave her man. That is me 100%. I wouldn't be able to leave my man, I would stay by his side to the end and be happy with my decision.
There were women on the Titanic that did stay of their own free will. Women who wouldn't leave their man. Mrs. Levi Strauss for one. I also believe Mrs.Vanderbilt  stayed on-board.
All that being said I was a Flight Attendant Continental Airlines and I was trained and prepared to assist all passengers off the plane before myself (that included men) The flight crew is the last to leave. 
I don't value my life over anyone else, especially if I could save a mother or father to a child over myself. I have no children and I know your children need you.
