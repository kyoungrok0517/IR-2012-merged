This is how I look at it... I've had family who've hit deers with their cars (I live in Vermont, so you get a lot of them) and the most damage that was caused is the front or corner of their car was busted. But, only in the the spot where it was hit. And both were in cars saying "Thank god it wasn't a huge deer because then it could have came into my windshild" 
SO, If I deer ever jumps out at me, I'm sorry to say, but I would probably hit it. I would rather it come in my windshield then me dogging and hitting a tree headon. The areas where the deer likes to jump out are just surrounding by trees! 
If I hit one, I don't think I would feel that guilty because hunting deer in my county is HUGE. Everyone talks about it at school. If I told them I hit a deer they'd prob say, "How many points did it have?" instead of how my car was XP

BUTTTTT, if it is a moose, that is another story HAHA XD
