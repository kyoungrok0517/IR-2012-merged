Yes it is true, you can buy a pool cue almost anywhere for just a few dollars. But all cues are not made equally and the biggest obstacle to growing your skill is the cue you shoot with. 

Originally I would not have said this as I believed that you could probably shoot with a tipped mop handle if you knew how to shoot. I happened to do a big favour for a professionally carded player with two world titles so I luckily became a coaching project. Now I liked my own cue, I had picked it out for the aesthetic design and I had paid $130.00 for it. I thought it was a great cue. The first thing the coach did was to hand me a $350.00 Joss cue and say this is yours, retire that piece of wood you’ve been using. I argued but lost. I did as I was told on the promise my game was about to take a leap. It did. And it took an even greater leap to a whole different level when I eventually moved up to and $850.00 Predator Cue. 

However, your question was, what should a beginner cue cost, and price is not the criteria that should determine your purchase. A good cue to practice your skill still needs to be a quality made cue that will provide least natural deflection. Weight and length are not really a question because to begin you have no real personal reasoning to make that choice and a standard 19oz, 58” billiard cue is the best starting point of reference. For price this could be a used Joss, McDermott, Falcon or Terminator Cue. However, the most reasonably priced brand new good hitting cue I have tried is a Richard Massey Cue and I recall this could be purchased for as little as $125.00 to $150.00. I bought one as a present for a beginner because it hit so well at that price range. Although. if I was just starting today I would definitely make my first purchase a Poison Cue and they start about $250.00.
