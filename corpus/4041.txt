Hold on, Don C...Heating the pool water, with the use of solar panels means that the pool water is going through the pipes. The pool water is treated with chlorine, and muriatic acid. If you pipe that treated water into the house, you will contaminate the household water supply. You could use the hot water for hosing out your garage, maybe. Not for drinking water.
