Hi Steven. I know of no connection with the two, but if you are on any medication for your Crohn's, that could be causing hair loss. Hair loss is a common side effect to a lot of medications. I have had hair loss twice as a side effect from medications i was taking, and never realized that could happen. I know 4 people with Crohns, and none of them suffer hair loss. One of the people i know that has it said their doctor wanted to give them a kind of steroid to help treat their Crohn's, but hair loss would have been a side effect of taking it, so she decided against it. So if you're on meds, i would look into that as a possible cause. Good Luck :-)
