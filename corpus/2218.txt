I've been into body building for just over a year and the results have been satisfactory although I can't seem to get rid of the last layer of fat.

I really want to have cuts and washboard abs, though I'm not a competitive bodybuilder nor am I into sports.

Are steroids worth it? What will it do to me? Side effects? Things to remember?
