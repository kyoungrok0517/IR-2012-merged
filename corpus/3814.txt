Oh I am all for alternative clean energy.
I would love nothing more than to tell the ragheads to eat their oil cause we are out f wheat.
One thing though.....Give us a VIABLE economic system that will not bankrupt the nation converting to it or put us ten years behind nations like China that are steaming full speed ahead.
You lay that on the table and i will pick it right up.
Till then we are stuck.
