The situation:

1) Your band was having trouble getting approval from an authority (probably not Christian) for your concert.

2) Your friend thought it would be good to fast and pray to God to change the minds of the people making the decision whether to let your band play or not.

My take:

1) Your friend's suggestion to fast is a good one, though not correctly motivated.  God is not bound to obey our desires if we fast.

2) Fasting, as many have mentioned, is a way to humble ourselves, i.e. become weak by not eating, and symbolizes our complete dependence upon God, as well as our desperation for His favor.  In New Testament terms, fasting is also a direct attack on our "flesh", our sinful nature that looks for satisfaction/fulfillment in food.

3) Finally, in response to another answer, regarding negotiating with God, Abraham negotiated (successfully) with God regarding Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18:22-33).  David was unsuccessful in his prayer/fasting for his first son with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12).

Hope that helps.
