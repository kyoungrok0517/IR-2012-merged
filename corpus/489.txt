I would say Middletown. It is about an hour out from NYC and also has a train station there. Many people who live there work in NYC. There is Redbank which is right next to it. It has a Beautiful downtown area with lots of night life. The schools are good and there is lots of shopping. It's also where Bon Jovi has a house. You can find a decent size house for 500,000.
