When  you are young, you should invest aggressively.  When you get older, you switch to moderate.  When you retire you get conservative.

When you are young and the market drops 50%, you laugh and say:  "It will recover before I retire."  If you are old and the market drops 50%, you laugh and say:  "I'm glad I shifted most of my money over into safer investments"
