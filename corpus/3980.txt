Earth911 is a good site for questions like this http://earth911.com/.

Keep in mind that all the information on Earth911 is provided by the individual recycling companies/processors themselves.  If their policies change, sometimes they forget to update their Earth911 information.  My recycling center (in Oklahoma) uses Earth911 to let our customers know what we do and don't accept.
