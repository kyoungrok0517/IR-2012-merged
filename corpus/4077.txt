You're not getting answers because you've asked way too many questions at once. We're here to help, but no one will want to spend that much time on it when it doesn't look like you have. You'll benefit much more if you do your own work, but I'll help by telling you how to find the answers. 

Google the key words in each of your questions, and you'll get thousands of hits full of answers. For the first one, for example, Google "glucose transport cell membrane" and then use what you find along with "diabetes" the next time. For the one after that, research "thermodynamics" and "entropy", and compare the information. Sometimes the answer to more than one question can be found in the article. In case you can't choose from the choices, for your purposes, wikipedia and ehow usually give good  answers that you'll be able to understand. Good luck!
