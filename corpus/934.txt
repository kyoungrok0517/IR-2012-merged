Toronto/Mumbai, (BollywoodWorld.com) With Tamils in India and Canada saying they are “very disturbed” by Amitabh Bachchan’s proposed visit to Sri Lanka to host the India International Film Awards (IIFA) function, the megastar Monday said he would respect everyone’s sentiments.

The Canadian Tamil Congress Sunday said, “Amitabh is a great hero for us in the Tamil diaspora, but we are very disturbed and profoundly saddened by our hero’s proposed visit to a regime which has perpetrated crimes against Tamils. By visiting Sri Lanka, Amitabh will be lending credibility to a regime which has destroyed Tamils ruthlessly and committed horrendous human rights violations.”
