Very difficult to do, because stress is not the "number one cause for obesity."  If what you were saying was true, then all of those poor concentration camp victims would have died of heart disease and diabetes, not from hunger.

The main cause for obesity is actually simply stated using basic mathematics:  too many calories in and too few calories out.  Said more simply, people eat too much and exercise too little.

You can try to relate overeating to stress, it is true to some extent, but there will be little evidence to support such a thesis.
