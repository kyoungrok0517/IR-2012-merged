its really simple, if your in the UK its probabbly a common frog and you can leave both of them together. feed them a pinch of goldfish food 3 times a day or give them two long worms a day and remove the remaining bits of the worm (make sure the worms alive). buy a goldfish bowl for...3 quid and fill it with cold tap water half way. then put in your tadpoles and a bit of decoration if you want. they'll also need some sort of land like a rock poking out of the water or piled up stones. clean there bowl around once ever 1-2 weeks and place them in a container filled with water. when the frogs are big enoung ( the size of your palm clenched together) take them to a park with a pond and place them into the pond reasuring yourself theyll be able to climb out of it. if you plan to keep them, get them a bigger tank and in winter youll need to freeze them in a block of ice (NOT FULLY FREEZE) but this is optional, you dont have to hibernate them. keep them out of direct sunlight so a quarter and a half of there bowl is in shade. if you keep them decorate there tank and name them. just ask me for more stuff! cheak out a good site below
