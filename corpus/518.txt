Good luck. When I first started I sent out over 80 resumes and only had one call and things were good in the market. I sent out resumes to every appraiser in the phone book in 4 countys. The problem is now there is not a lot of work and to split it with a trainee and would cut  into the appraisers fees. You will have to knock on every appraiser door in 50 miles. You may even have to find your own clients and thats hard when your a trainee, but if you can bring some clients to the appraiser, then they may take you in. You also have to understand you are dumber than a box of rocks as far a doing appraisals go.
Its a lot of work and takes a lot of time to train you and you are going to make very little the first couple of years around 20%-30% of the appraisal. I went through $20,000 from my savings, just to pay may bills the first couple of years. Its a long road, all up hill. Try  appraisersforum.com. they have a place you can post that you are looking for a trainee position. You have a lot more classes to take and that is a good place to network with other trainees.
