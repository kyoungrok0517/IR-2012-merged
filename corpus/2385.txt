First we should know to merit the inventions and claims to analys its truth.I am the one issued the warning 2 hours before Tsunami struck our coast. There is no secret in my prediction. The earthquake alarm designed by me just for the cost of about U.S $ 25 gave the warning for 12 minutes. As I know the concept of Richter scale I know that the earthquake sensed by my instrument should be from far away place and the magnitude must be very high. The book by name earthquakes author Mr Bruce A Bolt iv th edition says ( Page no 239 ) stay away from beaches and water front areas where Tsunami may strike long after the shaking is stopped. That is why I issued the warning to local T.V.Stations. They have not only ignored my warning they have also criticized me for my real useful observation.Even now nobody has shown proper interest to find the fact.There are several natural warning we get before major destruction takes place. Scientist have to come forward to find the truth.
