The answer to your question is that lava lamps don’t actually contain lava!! The inside of the lamps actually contain water and a "solidified globule of mineral oil, paraffin and a dye as well as paraffin wax or petroleum jell, preferably Ondina 17 with a light paraffin, carbontetrachoride, a dye and the paraffin wax or petroleum jelly." So of course, since there is no actual lava inside the lamp, the lamp won’t melt and nobody gets burns! The reason why it’s called a lava lamp is because it looks like there’s lava inside.
