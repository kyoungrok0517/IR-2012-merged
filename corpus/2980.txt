Even though your question was disrespectful and insulting, I'll try to answer your question. (By the way, you could have left that sentence out and this would have been a good question to answer) now you are more likely to get answers that will retaliate, because you provoked people. 

What you fail to understand is this: you are trying to quantify something here that cannot be quantified. 

It's like measuring who is the better painter: Picasso or Rembrandt. It's a judgment of people. So, scientifically you cannot determine who is the better painter.

My point by bringing this up is this: you are trying to measure something through scientific reasoning that cannot be measured scientifically. Faith cannot correlate to science. Two very different things. Religion is a different topic than science. Just like you cannot measure art through science. Yeah you can see evidence, but you cannot measure scientifically who is the better artist. 

That's the same concept about God. YOu cannot see God, because he does not take a physical form. So, scientifically there is no evidence that he exists. Instead, we see and understand God through faith. 

When you are willing to give God a chance and to trust him to show you that he exists, without demanding he comes under your conditions, then you may just learn what God truly is. But, it is going to take humbling yourself. Until you are willing to do that, God will not show himself to you. Why Because it is the equivalent of you demanding that a king of a country meet your demands. When you humble and ask God to show himself by giving him respect, then see what God will show you.
