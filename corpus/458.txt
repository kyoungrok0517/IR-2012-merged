The ONLY bulb that should be used is the bulb recommended by the manufacturer for the size of lamp you have. They do come in different sizes.
The new energy efficiency bulbs properly will not fit and even if they did would not get hot enough to melt the wax and make the lamp work.
Using too large a wattage of a bulb can also overheat the lamp and cause an explosion!!!!!

NEVER HEAT ONE ON THE STOVE, IT WILL EXPLODE!!!!! 
Sorry about the shouting but I have seen this in the news before!!!!! People have been killed.
They are safe to use, when used PROPERLY!

And I know of no lava lamp that has a motor in it.
