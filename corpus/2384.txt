1) Earthquakes are extremely common at plate boundaries. Knowing where these boundaries are gives us a better idea as to where to expect EQs

2) Yes and no. The more we know about plate tectonics the more we can learn about EQs. But EQs, though statistical in some ways, are still hard to predict.

3) Knowing the interior of the Earth helps us know how soon waves are going to end up in other places.

4) What hasn't been planned, plan and build away from prone areas. What has been planned and built needs protection and better warning systems.
