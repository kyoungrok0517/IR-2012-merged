Global warming will not kill off the oceans.  Its happened before, its happening now.  In the future it will happen over and over. 
Can the earth end by floods?  No.  Humanity is too spread out for floods to kill everyone.  Floods are strictly local events. Even if all the polar and greenland ice melts water level will only go up about 170 feet.  That will drown most of the earth's cities, which are frequently found on sea coasts, but that sort of melting takes some time, and people will move to higher ground. After futilly trying to build seawalls of course.  
   An asteroid impacting the oceans can cause mile high (or larger) tsumamis, but those would be the least of our problems: large oceanic impacts would likely trigger mini-iceages.  Now that could do the human population a serious hurt, but humans are very adaptable beasts and an iceage isn't likely to kill everybody.  
  I can think of three scenarios that would kill everything.
  1. a wandering black hole swallowing us.
  2.  impact by a major asteroid or planetoid.  The kind of impact that makes the oceans boil.  Or cracks us open like an egg.  
  3. A passing star, brown dwarf, or black hole disrupting our orbit around the sun, throwing us out into the interstellar void, becoming a rogue planet.  Life around the seafloor vents and deep undergound bacteria could survive, since energy for those creatures comes from the interior of the earth, but nothing else.
