Well, I can only speak as someone trained in clinical hypnosis. The answer to your question is more complex than just buying a video. You might have other issues that would better be treated with either a pharmacological solution or, depending on what is affecting your concentration, therapy. Also, not everyone is a good candidate for hypnosis nor does it work for everyone. 

With that said, hypnosis can only be effective in things you can normally "control" in your life. Like eating, smoking, etc. It can't, for example, improve your memory. So it *could* work for concentration unless you have an underlying neurological issue that keeps you from concentrating right now. Likewise, if the concentration is related to stress, etc. it might not be effective because the stress in your life would override the benefits of hypnosis.

I hope this information helps some. I doesn't directly answer your question, but I would rather you be more informed than to just get a "yes or no" and then be disappointing.
