I like Mexican food because of its use of chillies. 

I just love chillies in general - especially Thai food. But I also like Mexican purely because of the cheese and the chillies.

I can eat it for any occasion - lunch, snack or dinner. If it taste good and I have the opportinity to eat it then I will.

HOT HOT HOT stuff.. bring it on!
