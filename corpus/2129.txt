Because the Obama/Democratic Bailout of both GM and Chrysler had nothing to do with quality.  The point was to "redistribute" taxpayer's money and to set a precedent to destroy the property rights of bondholders.  

Bankruptcy law was turned on its head by this action.   The bailout was to keep the UAW voting for the Democrats.  Democratic friends in academia, the FRB, and the media are trying to spin the demotion of stockholders on the pecking order of claimants in a Bankruptcy as not visible.  

Perhaps the shock has not been seen yet.   But bondholder in the future will remember their loses.
