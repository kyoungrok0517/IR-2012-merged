Argue both sides of this case: Bill regularly rented a hotel room on the parade path for the Rosebowl. The hotel room rack or everyday rate is $ 125.00. On the parade days the rooms go for $400.00. Bill paid for the room and the hotel does not dispute that the room has been paid for. The day the parade was supposed to take place, there was a huge storm and parade was cancelled. Bill showed up to the hotel and demanded a full refund.
Give your opinion on what should happen . What doctrine is Bill relying on to excuse his performance under the contract?.
