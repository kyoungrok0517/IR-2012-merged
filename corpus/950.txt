Honestly, Jennifer Aniston is not a very good actress to win an Oscar. She doesn't have a wide range as an actress and she is not versatile enough to play different roles or make her characters believable. She doesn't have a great and powerful screen presence that stands out. She is much better on TV, instead of the movies. Brad Pitt might win one because he prove he can play drama, to action, to comedy, and thrillers roles.
