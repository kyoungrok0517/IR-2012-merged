The Pentatuch/Torah refers to the first five books of the Old Testament, all supposedly written by Moses. They are also called the book of the Law because all the guidelines and regulations for the Israelites are spelled out in these books. The Pentatuch, even today, is considered sacred by the Jews. Only Jewish men may read from the Pentatuch, starting at the age of thirteen.
