Definitely, however a record of complaint has to be established.  First a policy has to be put into effect regarding the objectionable things the employee does.  If that policy is already in place, the employee has to have been counseled about it verbally, in writing, and given a warning.  Complaints have to have been filed with the employer, (these can be anonymous) and the employer is wise to inform the employment agency of that State as to the nature of those complaints and the employer's intention.  This is crucial because t establishes a pattern of wrongful behavior, and safeguards the employer against wrongful termination charges.  It also keeps the employer from having to pay unemployment, since the employee failed to live up to the conditions of employment.  There could be another reason that the manager does not want to fire her however.  Most managers will put up with a certain amount of anti-social behavior if it means they get to keep a reliable employee with a great work history. You have to convince the manager that the rotten mood puts off customers and affects sales.  This is best done by getting written statements from customers, preferably ones you do not know or are related to, and preferably turned directly in to the manager!  (hint - hint)

Sometimes a staff meeting does the same job without having to fire anyone.  If the rest of the staff makes it generally known that they do not appreciate being bullied or ordered around outside the scope of their job descriptions, the grouchy employee will generally back off with nothing more than a warning.  It's amazing how fast bullies crumble in the face of real authority!
