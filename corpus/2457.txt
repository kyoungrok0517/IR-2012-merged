Let Bell discuss with an assistant. Bell has one of these old black phones and explains how this new invention is going to work.

But all his assistant does is make objections: how people will never want to pay the bills, that you can't see the person you're talking too, that the ring is too loud, that it's black and ugly, that you can't take it with you, etc, etc.

Bell objects at first and then becomes convinced that this new invention is completely useless. He throws it in a waste bin and leaves.

Just then the assistant receives a call on his mobile. He takes it from his pocket and tells the other person that he succeeded in convincing Bell *not* to make the telephone.
