I have found a foreclosed property (REO) that I wish to buy  from the Lender / Trustee. Cant leave a message with the phone # provided and I am unable to get any other info.
What is the best way to go about buying such a property?
This is in the state of California. Can this be bought as an investment property or does it have to be owner occupied.
