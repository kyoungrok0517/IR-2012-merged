Tanning beds DO NOT PROTECT YOU FROM BURNING. especially in the Caribbean. I have personally witnessed a women being helicoptered off the islands because she was so sun burned, her skin cracked, blistered and weeped.
For the Caribbean put sun blocker on constantly.  You are not a native.  You WILL burn, and you can get skin cancer.
