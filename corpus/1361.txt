I read on a commercial website that 500 mg of calcium orotate, for example, contains only 52mg of elemental calcium. What is the proportion for calcium citrate? 
I want to order Citracal for osteoporosis. I read on their website that the recommended daily intake is 1500 mg. But does that mean elemental calcium or the whole molecule?

Secondly, I read some good stuff about calcium orotate. How does this compare with calcium citrate?

Thirdly, is it necessary to add magnesium, and in which proportion, to the calcium? Some sources insist that it is important, but neither my doctors, nor the Citrical website mention it.
