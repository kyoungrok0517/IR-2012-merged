Two and one-half years I had 2 stents placed in my rt coronary artery. Last Dec I had angioplast in the same area due to constriction (95%). I also suffer from COPD, I was told that there was a good chance that the angioplasty would not be very permanent. In Jan my lung function greatly decreased. I suffer from short windedness. Is there a way to determine whether this is heart related or lung related other than catherization. Also is there a possibility that my decrease in lung functifon is related or caused by my angioplasty in December.
