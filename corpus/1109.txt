You can tell them, they will probably laugh. Then ask you if you paid the ticket. If you just pay the ticket and take a copy of the receipt with you. I see no issue here.  It was a tree, unless they are charging for assaulting a tree, nothing here to see. This is no different then getting a ticket for jaywalking.  The only people in involved is you.
