I can't get a tan!!!
I'm allergic to fake tan
I burn in the sun for too long
so my only other choice is sun beds? My sister goes twice a week and says i should go with her

but i'm worried because it's been on the news recently as dangerous because of it increases cancer risks
what do you think? Is it worth it?
I think i should because i am soooo white and want to be tanned for the summer!!!
and everythin these days is a cancer risk!
hahaha i have watched final destination 3!! but i don't think that's likely to happen! and btw i live in Britain, so we don't get much sun here, well not enough to get a tan anyway!
