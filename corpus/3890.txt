I find it incredibly frustrating. As a graduate student, I spend a lot of my time(read: every waking minute) on campus. As with most colleges, we get  few thousand freshman in each year, a couple hundred foreign students, and everyone's crammed together in poorly ventilated lecture halls in the hundreds, while people discover the exquisite ways you can destroy your health with college food. Needless to say, almost every year we have measles. Almost every year we have meningitis.

Keep in mind that measles was essentially dead in the US about a decade ago. There were no cases from local sources. And of course the children of the anti-vaccers come into college and it's like gas on a fire.

These people don't remember what it was like fifty years ago or more. My grandmother recently wrote up part of her life. One of the things that struck me was polio. In her college dorms(in the late 30s/40s), they'd go and check each morning to make sure everyone in the building could feel and move their feet, because people would wake up paralyzed, or unable to move their legs, and just be stuck in bed. Think about that for a moment, infectious disease is -nothing- like that anymore. When my father was about ten, he caught the mumps, and they basically quarantined the house. No visitors, my dad was stuck in the furthest room on a couch to keep his siblings from getting it.

We don't see babies from mothers with rubella anymore. The kind of scarring, dysfigurement and crippling that came as a result of that. Where are diptheria, tetanus and their friends? When was the last time you saw a quarantine sign in public?

I dunno. It's depressing though.
