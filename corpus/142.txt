Alright here are a few reasons why overpopulation is nothing to worry about. 
1. The Demographic Transition Model
As a country enters the final stage of development (i.e. France or Japan), the birth rates decline significantly due to urbanization and the higher living costs that come with higher standards of living. Thus, most couples only have one or two kids per household. Almost every country in Europe has a small, if not negative birth rate. This trend is starting to happen in the US, China, and India as well. The countries with the highest birth rates are in Africa and the Middle East, the most under-developed in the world. In short, the more advanced a society, the smaller it's natural increase rate. 
2. Genetically Modified Organisms 
For decades, we have been genetically modifying crops in order to optimize our food output. We have the technology to create plants that grow faster, or require less water. The artificial strain of IR36 rice helped India become completely independent of other nations for food. The same thing happened in Mexico with modified corn species. With this technology, we can grow more food with less space in order to feed a growing population.
3. Prices
Whenever a certain commodity, such as food or water, becomes scarce, the price for that commodity goes up. This then causes people to buy much less of the commodity and ration it out more. This way, whenever shortages occur, their is equal distribution. What could also happen is that the high prices give an incentive to find alternative products, like when natural rubber became expensive during WW2 and they started producing synthetic rubber. In this manner, people will still have what they need in the end. 

Look at all of these and tell me that war is the proper solution.
