It is about the spiritual growth when ones denies the self/flesh of something.   The way of the world is to engorge the self with everything that gratifies the flesh.  Its basically a worship of the carnal, animal self.   The only reason we don't like our A hole is cuz we cant reach it.  We love our animal self, and refuse to refine our spirit.  

We need another flood.
