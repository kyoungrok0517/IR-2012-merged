nutcrackers, like the kind from the ballet. not the kind you actually use to crack nuts

i've collected them since before i can remember, my oldest ones i dont remember getting, my newest one is a handmade steinbach Braumeister, it's beautiful

I would love to expand my collection, but handmade nutcrackers and antique ones are expensive!!!

my Steinbach cost 130 on discount and thats about the most i can spend on any given nutcracker

anywho, thanks for any answers!
