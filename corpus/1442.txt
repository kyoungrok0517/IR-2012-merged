for my physics homework we were asked to explain how the design if a motorcycle helmet protect the skull. We have been given the information that a motorcycle safety helmet has a soft inner lining which is compressed on impact during an accident. 

i'm really stuck with this question and i can't seem to find anything related to it in the notes we were given. any help is much appreciated.
