Oh sweets!  Halloween is NOT childish.  Some people can be childish...but Halloween is anything but childish.  Besides, you're still young and you know the old reply from EVERYONE: enjoy being young because when you're out the house and on your own..it's all downhill from there!  LOL!  Seriously, I miss being a kid and am a bit envious of my own kids and my 15 yr. old sister who gets to do all that fun kiddie stuff w/out "grown ups" giving her funky looks(I'm like a 40 yr. old teenager..I shop/wear clothes from Hot Topic, my hair has dark red streaks, I have a pierced nose...you know..stuff like that) like me...  Do whatever you want for Halloween to have fun; IE, go to parties, if you want trick or treat(FYI..I've seen kids 17+ trick or treating, and I'm in Chicago..so don't feel weird), pass out candy, dress up and just enjoy!  Just so you know, my son is going to be Buddy the Elf, my husband maybe be either Jimi Hendrix or Indiana Jones, my baby toddler may be a lady bug or a witch, and I'm going to be Janis Joplin and we're going to trick or treat and hang out at Freaky Frights in North Riverside.
