The calcium is there as calcium phosphate and calcium casinate, see article below.  Calcium carbonate can be added to milk to fortify but has to be very fine to stay in suspension say 90% finer than 2 microns and then not added in great quantities.  Calcium casinate and phosphate do dissolve easier in the human gut normally by the action enzymes, where calcium carbonate requires the stomach acid to digest.  The enzyme extract gets into the body quicker than the carbonate but both make a good contribution to calcium fortification to prevent osteoporosis.
