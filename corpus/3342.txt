School uniforms are good because it puts everyone on equal footing. In other words you don't have the clique girls playing barbie doll and competing with each other to see who can be the hottest. It also gets rid of the issues of gang colors. I think the uniforms are good because then the children can focus on learning instead of playing pop culture. I always crack up when I see the kids that only care about how they look, how cool they are. Those children tend to have sh*t for brains and will be tomorrows macdonalds workers. Perhaps if they are forced to get away from this pop culture popularity contest they will finally read a book. I understand that the popularity games will still go on. I will tell you. I am appalled at some of the writing and questions I see on Yahoo answers from children who are in high school. 

Which great lake is farthest west? For a high school student who is versed in the internet to not have the ability to pull up a map of the United States and look for themselves blows my mind. Although I would wager that this student could easily tell you everything about the latest pop singer. The United States has become very dumbed down. 

Is it the schools fault. NO NO NO NO. It is the fault of parents. When you park your child in front of a television for 6 hours a day thats what you get. 
School uniforms are a start.
