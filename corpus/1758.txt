A hair transplant does not prevent the (going to fall hairs) from falling. It only replaces the bald portion. So having a hair transplant will in no way protect the old hairs which were going to fall in the normal process. Its therefore usually recomended that you do the hair transplant at the right stage i.e. around 20 - 30% of the normal original hair.

In your case you can get the remaning hairs done in one more transplant. Also take care of the hairs you have now. i.e. the original ones from falling. Reduce your stress levels by doing meditation like yoga. Eat lot of vegetables and fruits in diet. Also using hair oil is recomended to stop hair loss. Start meditating regularly for reducing the stress levels. Also exercise to keep the blood flow normal. Apart from this check if you have dandruff, as its the main cause of hairloss in many. I have read a related article somewhere on stophairlossquick.com and it did benefit me.
