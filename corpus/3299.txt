Colleges are run completely differently from high schools. Not only would there be absolutely no way of enforcing such an arbitrary rule as uniforms, but all of the reasons that they are present in high schools ( to give more uniformity, to help students focus more on their studies instead of the clothing they wear, etc) are obsolete in college.
