Tornadoes are formed from supercell storms. Horizontal rotation from the storm gets pulled vertical by the updraft and downdraft areas of the storm. If the rotation is strong enough, this will cause a lowering from the cloud base which is known as a wall cloud. As the rotation gets stronger, it can create rotation at the ground. The RFD(rear flank downdraft) will brings strong gusts downward to help with the rotation. If you see a rotating wall cloud and debris being kicked up on the ground underneath the wall cloud, then it is a tornado. You do not have to have a full condensation funnel to constitute a tornado.
