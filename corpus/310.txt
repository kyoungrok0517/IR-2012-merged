Supposedly to prove to God that you can take torture and sacrifice. I guess the faster believes that God will give them the sustenance they need to survive. I once frequented a church that most of the parishioners regularly fasted. I was urged by my pastor to fast. I adamantly refused. I deny myself nothing. Bye,I have to go to the liquor store and start grilling my steak.

Oh yea, If you dare fast make sure to drink lots of water.Good luck.
