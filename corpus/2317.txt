Tornadoes can be formed in different ways.  The most common way is from low level shear zones that are overtaken by supercellular thunderstorms.   Low level winds change both direction and speed as altitude increases.  This shear creates a sort of horizontal turning in the lower atmosphere.  As a storm passes over this area the updraft in the storm tilts the horizontal roll into the vertical, creating what is known as a mesocyclone. From there other processes which are not yet fully understood can tighten the rotation in parts of the mesocyclone, which in turn increases the rotational speed.  From there the vortex can descend and make contact with the surface, a tornado.  Their strengths are normally determined by the amount of instability in the area as well as the available low level shear.  Eventually at least one of these ingredients diminishes, resulting in the demise of the tornado.
