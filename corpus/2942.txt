Melbourne, Australia. You have everything here. The people are friendly. It's isolated enough so that people think we ride kangaroos to work. And it's just... a really nice place.

It's very livable. Horrible to visit in terms of a tourist's point of view, but once you come here to stay, you don't want to leave.
