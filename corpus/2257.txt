MAD, MAD, MAD, it's all about MAD (mutually assured destruction)

The quote was from 1953.  I don't know where.  Why should be obvious.

Oppenheimer is reported to have quoted from the Indian book “Bhagavad Gita” when he witnessed the first tests of the nuclear bomb: 

"If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendour of the Mighty One."
 
Later, he mentioned another verse that was on his mind, namely 

"I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."
