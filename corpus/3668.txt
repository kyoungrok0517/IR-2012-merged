When you know you have reach that high level in life and you think, man I did that? but later on, when it keeps on happening, you get appreciation for what you done, you kinda get bored right?

Well, the truth is, our mind can only go up only that much and nothing else. We live on this earthly physical world where things goes rotten and nothing stays pure.

The truth is, only God can fill that depressive spot. You know, seek for Him and listen.
