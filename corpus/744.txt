I have not seen flourescent light bulb rated for fish tank that screw in regular incandescent bulb base.  They make the flourescent  light hoods which is what you should do.  If you use one of the flourescent 15w replacements they sell for regular incandescents in the house you will also find the light level equal to about a 60watt light bult.
