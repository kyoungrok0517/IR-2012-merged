We have a 6,000 gallon inground saltwater pool made of fiberglass. We live in the Savannah, GA area and are looking into cheap ways to heat our pool during the winter months so we can use it almost year-round. What is the best way to heat this type of pool (i.e. heat pump, solar cover, rooftop solar heating system) without spending a ton of money?
I am looking to spend less than $500.
