I thought you were pulling a Nirvana Boy for a minute there.

I love his version of "oh me"

But i love how he brought the Meat Puppets on stage, he said he was gonna bring a guest and everyone thought he would bring like Eddie Vedder and they would have a super grunge show. But he brought an underground band. People should have expected that though, very typical Kurt thing to do.

BQ-Favorite Alice In Chains unplugged Nutshell or got me wrong

I really love AIC unplugged though, when the cd store near my house was going out of business and they had a sale i went in and just picked up AIC unplugged without thinking much. But when i put it on and heard nutshell I was really just blown away. The videos are hard to watch though because Layne looks so sick you just want to give him a hug. Still its probably the best unplugged show.
