The idea that steroids automatically produce a muscular physique IS A MYTH.

If you use steroids and never get up off the sofa, you can be as pear-or-apple-shaped as you like, and stay that way.

If your training mainly involves heavy, regular Leg & Buttock exercises, then taking steroids will help to build these muscles, making you even more pear-shaped than you already are.

By performing a lot of low-intensity ('long & light') lower-body exercises, and some increasingly heavy or intense upper-body work, a pearshaped person will gradually become 'V-shaped'. (Swimming, especially 'Crawl' or 'Freestyle', often produces this effect.)

Taking steroids can help to speed up the process, but this is usually a bad idea; rapid changes in your physique are often temporary and can cause long-term damage.
