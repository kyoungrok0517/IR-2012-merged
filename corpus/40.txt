About a year ago my fiancee and I moved in with my parents. We brought 2 bengals, and a regular cat with us. Patches, the regular cat, gets along with my oldest cat Roger very well. They are best buddies, but to this day, the 2 bengals, especially the girl chases Roger under a bed and he will hide for an hour or 2. When the girl bengal chases Roger, it gets Patches all excited and he chases him as well, and hisses and swats at him hard. But 5 min. later Patches and Roger will be fine...

2 weeks ago we got a baby kitten bengal, who is loving and very playful and does not chase Roger, but Roger gets SO scared of him that he runs and hides, he looks at this kitten like it is as big as him when the kitten does not bother him...

Is there any way to get Roger use to the bengals? Or is he too old?!
