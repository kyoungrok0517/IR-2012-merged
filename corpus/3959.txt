Bees are attracted to sugars. Soda pop cans, beer cans, etc. Make sure before you recycle the cans rinse them out really good and dry them really good. Keep them in a garbage bad or plastic bag and close it tight so the bees can't get inside the bag or cans. If this does not work then i recommend spraying around and on the trash can with bee repellent or wasp repellent.
