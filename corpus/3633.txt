I don't know that appliances need to be included - if so, a fridge definitely is not required.  I just bought a house with an FHA loan and it doesn't have a fridge which was not an issue.  The inspector did note that there was chipping paint on the outside of the house that had to be fixed along with repairing the mortar between the bricks on the exterior.  

Basically the house's electrical and plumbing systems must work and the structure needs to be sound.  I don't know whether or not holes on interior walls would be a problem or not.
