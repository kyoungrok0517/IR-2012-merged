1) Volcanoes are formed when magma from within the Earth's upper mantle works its way to the surface. At the surface it erupts to form lava flows and ash deposits. Ash deposits result from more explosive activity and lava flows usually are associated with quieter activity. Anyway, once you have piled up lava and/or ash around the vent, you have a young volcano. After many many more eruptions you have a big volcano that is constructed of the ash and lava products of these eruptions. 

2)  Mt. Tambora, Indonesia, 1816 – Death Toll: 92000 – This cataclysmic event that happened on April 10-15, 1816 killed about 92,000 individuals which included 10,000 whose caused of death is due to the ash fall and explosion, and about 82,000 from other causes attributable to the volcanic eruption.

3) It's not too hard to predict when a volcano will erupt, there will always be warning signs.  magma (molten rock) rises towards the surface, breaking rock en route. The magma also causes ground deformation. "As magma rises into a volcano, it has to make space for itself and that means that the ground has to swell.
