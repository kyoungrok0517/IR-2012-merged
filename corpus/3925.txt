My sister has estrogen dependent fibroids and is on the pill-she is convinced- because 3 doctors have told her so she says-that she will bleed profusely if she stops the pill-that the fibroids need the estrogen to fight themselves or something along those lines. Am i the only person who this does not make any sense to? Can someone please make me understand this.
