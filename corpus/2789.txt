I'm sure the first answer is the best, but people at the time assocaited smell with the plague and would walk around with pomanders (oranges with cloves in) as a way toward off the plague as that is what they believed.
They also quarentined houses, by putting a cross on doors of those who had the plague.
Good luck with the project
