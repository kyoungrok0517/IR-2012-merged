What's withheld is just like the withholding from your paycheck.  When you fill out your tax form, you calculate your total tax, then that's compared to what was withheld - if you had too much withheld, you get the extra refunded, and if you didn't have enough withheld, you have to pay the amount you're short.  You're not being double taxed in either case.  The amount that's withheld at the time you withdraw the money is applied to the tax you owe when you file your return.

You pay income tax at whatever your rate is on the amount you withdraw, plus a 10% penalty if you take it out before you're 59-1/2.
