I've been waiting for this moment all my life. Finally when the awards are taking place in Toronto, my home city, it seems as though the tickets are sold out :( I'm not exactly sure so i was wondering is there ANY way to get tickets!! Or is there anyone who does not want their ticket and would sell it to me. Honestly please help, i cant believe i don't have tickets to the awardssss ceremonyy :( !!
@ Hari: Do you live in Toronto? How would I go about buying the tickets?
