you could make him up to be the " Slinky " dog...you know? the toy that the little kids who are too young to play with REAL slinkys get?...

it has a dog's head and behind ( you already have that part !.) ....and the middle is a  " slinky " ...it's on wheels...and has a string so they can pull it behind them.....and when they pull it, well...it slinkys....

and, maybe you could use one of those aluminum dryer hoses to make the " Slinky " part?....
