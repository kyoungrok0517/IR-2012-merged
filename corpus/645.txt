I have a dachshund (wiener dog) his name is luck, he is a male. When ever he is taken on walks on a hot day, or when he gets revved up he Starts having an asthma attack, i've never seen any other wiener dogs have asthma attacks. Is this normal? and how can i prevent the or make them less often?
his name is lucky
He's a standard Dachshund (wiener dog)
