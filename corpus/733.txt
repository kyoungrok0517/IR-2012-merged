Does the doggie want to sleep outside? I had a Sheltie that loved to sleep outside when the night time temp was between about 60 and 70. I'd say if it was comfy for you, it would be comfy for poochie. Otherwise, bring the dog in at night when you sleep.
But in general, the dog needs to be with his family, that is, inside the house with YOU.
