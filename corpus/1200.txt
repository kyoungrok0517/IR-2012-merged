I'll be sleeping in my nice warm bed. But I think my dh will be taking our son to watch it, along with his scout troop, they have friends on the royal court.

It is supposed to be 70' that day, but bring some of those pocket hand-warmers you can get at camping stores, just in case. It can be cold in the morning even if it's sunny later on. The weather has been cooold (well, for here!). 

Have lots of fun! It's a great experience. And take photos when you get the chance!
