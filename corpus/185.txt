"Now as to the signs of the "Great Battle" or Armageddon in Islam, Allah Almighty and Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him did prophesize about the great battle of Armageddon.  Prophet Muhammad gave signs of its occurrence, but neither he or Allah Almighty say that we Muslims will win it.  The actual promised victory is when Jesus peace be upon him comes back to earth to fight the Anti-Christ and all of the evil on earth after the occurrence of the "Great Battle" or Armageddon." 

lol Crazy nutty stuff.
