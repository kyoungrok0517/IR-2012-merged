Ok I lose respect towards some WWE superstars when I find out they use steroids! Would you say Undertaker uses steroids cuz I love him and it woud suck if I found out he used steroids! I think he has a natural body and hes not on roids! But I think Batista has the fakest body in WWE, but hey thats just my opinion! So who do you think uses steroids? Theres no way to prove it but its just specultations!

Just please answer this Q: Does Taker use roids?
