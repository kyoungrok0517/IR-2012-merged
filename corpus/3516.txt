Dr. Alan Woolf: The concern about honey, whether raw or processed, is that sometimes the honey has spores of a particular germ in it (Clostridium botulinum spores). Babies have particular types of bacteria in their intestine, so that they don't handle these spores very well that are in honey, and spores can germinate inside the baby's intestine and cause the bacteria to grow, and the young infants can come down with a condition called infantile botulism, which can present with a variety of symptoms including neurological ones, that can be very harmful. So that's why we don't recommend honey for infants. By the time the baby is about one-year-old or older, their immune systems and intestines have changed, so they don't have the same reaction to these spores, so honey is safe for toddlers, but not so for young infants. I would recommend that children under the age of 12 months not have raw or processed honey.
