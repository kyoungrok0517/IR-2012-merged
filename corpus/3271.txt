Even if you trusted your friend to do the right thing, would you want her to learn about plastic surgery from free online sights so that she could practice on you? I'm not saying that hypnosis is that dangerous but I am trying to put it into some kind of perspective. Hypnosis can be quite beneficial in dealing with phobias but honestly your friend would be better served but seeing an experienced specialist. I know you may have the absolute best intentions but you could do more damage than good with out the proper experience.
