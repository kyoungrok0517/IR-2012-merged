Pheromones are biological chemicals thought to prevent inbreeding (people are turned off by others with pheromone scents similar to their own).  The main outlet for natural pheromones is sweat, but synthetic pheromones can be purchased.  For the most part, these are scams and quite expensive (and don't smell that great).  Think about it, people are attracted to some pheromones and repelled by others.  You've already got your own natural pheromones that might be attractive to some people and offensive to others.  Why would you use a synthetic product that is also attractive/offensive, but to different people?  What if you meet someone and then stop using the pheromone scent?  Do you really want to spend $100 a month as long as you're with this person?  You'd be better off getting a nice fragrance and brushing up on your charm rather than looking for an easy fix.
