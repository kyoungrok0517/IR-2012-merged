Well frankly this small dog should not be sleeping outside due to the size, but then again, any dog in winter or cooler temps should not be sleeping outside at all,, without great sleeping conditions, heated kennel, a terrific dog house well insulated with covers galore inside, no hay, it promotes mange really easy.

But, since your dog loves the outdoors, I would only allow short periods of time outside and sleeps indoors at night, just for the baby's protection......dogs get chilled so easy.

And, I don't think any one meant to say you do not love your dog, but was concerned with a small dog being outside at night in cold temps.

just protect the baby really well, if the dog insists on being outside, then invest a well insulated dog house, point to the south away from the cold winds and build a very good blanket bed inside, and it would be nice to get the dog house with a dogie door, so he can in and out on his own.

good luck, and remember, what seems to be just cool to us, could be freezing for a small dog.
