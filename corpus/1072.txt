Baltimore cruise parking is not bad, you don't need advance reservations to park in the lot located on the South Locust Point Marine Terminal. Long-term parking is located within walking distance of the Passenger Building and courtesy/handicap shuttles are available. Parking fees cash or traveler's checks only.
