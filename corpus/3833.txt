How many of you met an asshole boss that overloaded you with tasks and after no training provided and orientation week or two fired you with no reasonable explanation?
For example: "I don't know what u r doing wrong, but there must be something." or " I don't like people who are nosy, and you are that kind of person" (bec. you was trying to be social and friendly at work, not bec. you was searching thru his stuff or asking about his or hers personal life.)
Any of you worked in such environment? I thought Devil wears Prada was just eggsaturated vision of script writter, but now I see that this things happen for real. Anyway if any of you met such idiots at work, please let me know what did you do, or what didn't you do although you would if you could? How and where did you find a better job and new environment that was much friendlier than previous one. Thanks :)
