I think it was called like "hells gate" or something like that.  I remember it being in the middle east.  It is a giant hole that apparently has gas that was ignited decades ago and is still burning.  The pictures were unbelievable and now i cant find it again because i dont remember what it was called.   Does anyone know what im talking about?
