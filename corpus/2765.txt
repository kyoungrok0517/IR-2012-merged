There were methods that did work. "Cities were hardest hit and tried to take measures to control an epidemic no one understood. In Milan, to take one of the most successful examples, city officials immediately walled up houses found to have the plague, isolating the healthy in them along with the sick. Venice took sophisticated and stringent quarantine and health measures, including isolating all incoming ships on a separate island. But people died anyway, though fewer in Milan and Venice than in cities that took no such measures. Pope Clement VI, living at Avignon, sat between two large fires to breath pure air. The plague bacillus actually is destroyed by heat, so this was one of the few truly effective measures taken.

As plague epidemics occurred regularly after 1350, preventive measures emerged. Plague patients were placed in pesthouses, isolated from the general population. Ships coming from plague infested areas were forced to stay out of port for a 40 day quarantine until the disease died out.
