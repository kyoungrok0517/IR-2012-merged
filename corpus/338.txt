A quit claim deed only gives away rights, it does not get rid of obligations (liens, taxes, etc.).  If the lender had a lien on the property for the loan, that would be senior to anything you did later with a quit claim deed.

So if the lender foreclosed on the property, the legal owner is whoever bought the property in the foreclosure sale.  At that point the quit claim deed would effectively be worthless, so I hope someone did not pay money for it.
