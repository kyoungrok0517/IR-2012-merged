This does not make sense to me either , but when you look at general practices of allopathic medicine, not much does. 

 The fibroids need the estrogen to grow, they do not fight themselves and won't just go away. The more estrogen they get, the larger they will grow. 

Generally with fibroids you will have heavy menstrual bleeding, abdominal bloating, menstrual cramps (severe) and spotting, as well as anemia from the heavy bleeding. fibroids are generally formed by excess levels of estrogens in the body. These estrogens can come from a wide variety of sources, as xenoestrognes are in most foods and drink products on the market today (unless they are labeled hormone free). Also a diet high in caffiene and fats contribute to fibroids. Other factors that contribute to fibroids are : deficient levels of essential fatty acids, hormone imbalances, underactive thyroid, birth control pills, and X-rays. 

With estrogen dominance you will have very low levels of progesterone. Adding a progesterone cream may help as well as using a vaginal suppisitory made of yarrow.
