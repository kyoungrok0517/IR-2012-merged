I think you will be set for sure.  Maybe not at 40 because you will have expenses along the way (house, car, medical, possibly a family, etc.) But for sure 45-50.  I think its awesome youre like 14 and already saving.  I am saving up for college and a car.  I haven't even thought bout retirement.  But why not enjoy retirement while youre young!
