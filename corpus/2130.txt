I'm writing a story with a character who had some sort of illness as a child that had her hospitalized for a long time, and resulted with her having permanent hair loss. At first I was going to go with cancer, until I found out that hair loss caused by chemotherapy grows back after a few months. It also doesn't have to be strictly a children's disease, just something that a 5 year old girl could possibly have.
