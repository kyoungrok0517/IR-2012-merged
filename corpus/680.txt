dress him up as a Zeppelin!  Remember the Hindenburg??  Or a mini-limo!

How about making him a little Kaiser?  You know, get one of those helmets with the pointy thingy on it.  

making him look like a German Shepherd or a Rotty (too cute) OR attach wings and make him a jet. (his body is the fuselage) or make him Noah's Ark.

There are tons of things you can make your wiener dog be besides a hot dog or missile.

I'd stick with the German theme though.......
