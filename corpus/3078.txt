A. Cosmic rays produce the water through complex interactions in the thin Martian atmosphere.
B. The same amount of frozen liquid water is always on the surface. The “growth” of the ice
caps is merely the water-ice expanding during the winter.
C. The growth of the ice caps is residual of the ancient Martian canal system. Trace amounts
of water on Mars migrate towards the poles during specific times during the Martian year.
D. The ice only appears to be growing, and we’re actually seeing the ice move akin to glacier
movements on Earth.
E. The growth of the ice comes from frozen gases in the Martian atmosphere.
