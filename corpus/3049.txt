Now that I have reached a half a decade in this journey, I do like this quote to a fruition. It certainly has its degrees of accountability. Although in my journey I have probably caused more wounds than received them, I do know that some of my deepest afflictions are nothing more than a distant memory. A scar barely noticeable. Healing does mean forgiveness although, I find that more than forgiveness, acceptance and closure are the true healers.
