Bees keep getting in the trash can in which I recycle aluminum cans.  This makes it impossible for me to recycle the cans without getting stung.  I usually just give up and throw the aluminum cans away.  Is there any way to keep the bees out of the container that I recycle my cans in?  I am open to all suggestions.
