Check out the first link for some commercially available heavy cues. Your next option would be custom. Most custom cue makers will give you whatever weight you specify, but it may cost a bit more than what you're looking to spend.

Even though a lot of cues come with adjustable weight bolts, you may not be able to find a weight bolt heavy enough and it would transfer the balance of the cue farther back. There were also some 25 oz cues on ebay a while back, but I'm not sure if they're still there.
