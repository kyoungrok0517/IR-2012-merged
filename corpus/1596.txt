I have heard a few songs by Nirvana. Smells Like Teen Spirit, Heart Shaped Box and a few others. I personally enjoy Pearl Jam, but was intrigued by the amount of people who love Nirvana on Y!A. The songs that i listed above, i find to be extremely obnoxious and bad. 

My question is, are there any Nirvana songs that are like, less annoying?
