This is tricky, because the two very often go together!

Generally, a craving that is JUST a craving is when you want to eat a particular thing, but you're not hungry because you've eaten recently (say, within the last 2 hours after a normal meal). It's okay to indulge a craving sometimes, but if you think it's only a craving, then have a small amount rather than an entire plate. For example, eat just a large spoon of ice cream instead of an entire dish. 

Actual hunger affects you physically. Your stomach may rumble. You may feel a bit sluggish and low energy. You might even get cranky or woozy or "fuzzy headed" if you've gone too long without eating. It's not really good to wait until you experience all of these symptoms to eat, though, because by then your blood sugar is doing weird things and that's not good for you. Mostly you feel an "empty" feeling in your stomach that makes you think "Food!", and once you've eaten something you stop thinking about food and go back to other things. 

It's actually a GOOD idea to indulge a craving some of the time, because a craving can mean that you're deficient in a vitamin or mineral, so you may crave foods that have those nutrients. Also, studies show that people who give into cravings regularly overall eat LESS than people who deprive themselves on strict diets. If you "eat as you feel" and in moderation rather than denying yourself, then you'll more naturally regulate your own food intake and maintain a healthier weight.
