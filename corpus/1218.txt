awww are you crushing on me? i hate to say it cuz im taken but you are actually making me crush on u too and my bf hasn't been treating me very nicely and basically has been using me to buy him stuff.. i mean i don't mind buying him a computer but paying for his phone bill and getting him nexon cash is a little too much but yeah im starting to crush on u now =] <3

also, my cousins live in san jose and idk when we'll see them next =/ we saw them in 2005 when we all went to wisconsin dells together but yeah i'd LOVE to meet u too and just spend time with u =]

i also marched in the rosebowl parade in 2003, you might've seen me if u went.. i was with the homestead spartan alliance band

WHAT SHOULD I SAY? I WANT TO MEET HIM! My heart burns with desire and I'm AMAZED by what he just said =D
