I keep looking for a free source of information on defense contractors. Almost everything out there either costs to join, has out-dated lists or you have to go to multiple sites to get a little bit of information.  I'd like to use my decades of military experience to make a decent living.  Almost everything I've found from the Transition Assistance Program classes is useless.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks!!
