For some reason the bank has decided they do not want the house.  it could be that they know something about the house that makes them not want it.  Flood plain, falling apart, asbestos, who knows.  Only the bank knows why they don't want it.  If I were the homeowner I would actually begin to wonder why the bank doesn't want it.  that is very unusual.

Also, loans are not FDIC insured.  Bank accounts (where you deposit money) are FDIC insured, not loans.
