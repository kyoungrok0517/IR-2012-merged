May he rest in Peace, my grandfather knew his father and mother real well and always thought Edmund was a real nice boy no surprise he became the man he did. Not only brave but had that one thing a real celebrity should have a lot of respect for others. Always said if the world had a few million more families like the Hillary's the world would be such a great place.
