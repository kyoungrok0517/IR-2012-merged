Hi Katie,
Hope this helps.

Sir Edmund Percival Hillary, KG, ONZ, KBE (born 20 July 1919) is a New Zealand mountaineer and explorer.

He and Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay were the first climbers to reach the 8,848 m (29,028 ft) summit of Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. They achieved this on 29 May 1953 at 11:30 a.m. local time. The feat was accomplished as part of the ninth British expedition to Everest, led by John Hunt.

Recognition
 
Edmund Hillary on the New Zealand five-dollar noteHillary was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) on 16 July 1953; a member of the Order of New Zealand (ONZ) in 1987; and a Knight of the Order of the Garter (KG) on 23 April 1995. He is the only living New Zealander to appear on a banknote. Various streets, schools, and organisations around New Zealand and abroad are named after him. A few examples are Hillary College (Otara), Edmund Hillary Primary School (Papakura), and the Hillary Commission (now SPARC).

To mark the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of Everest, the Nepalese Government conferred honorary citizenship upon Sir Edmund at a special Golden Jubilee celebration in the capital, Kathmandu. He is the first foreign national to receive such an honour from the Nepalese.

Sir Edmund's life was darkened by the loss of his wife and daughter in a plane crash in 1975. Hillary later remarried and continues to occupy himself with environmental causes.
