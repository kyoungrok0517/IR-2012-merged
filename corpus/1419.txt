I may be way off base here, but wouldn't the headlight on your bike really be what catches someones attention more than a helmet? When I'm driving my car I have never noticed any motorcyclist because of the color helmet they are wearing. I always notice the headlight and if it's dark I notice anything reflective, but not colors. I hear this topic a lot but personally I don't think it matters that much.
