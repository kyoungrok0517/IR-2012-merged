For the most part, no other animals should be kept in an enclosure with an American Toad (probably what you found in your yard); toads are carnivorous, and will generally eat anything smaller than them, be it all the crickets they can reach, or your firebelly frogs. The toad will probably either eat your frogs or stress them out by eating all their prey. Also, the frogs need an aquatic habitat, whereas toads need a more terrestrial habitat.
