As a professional, certified hypnotherapist, I have given a number of sessions to help clients (and myself) to experience pleasant, peaceful surgical experiences, in cases spanning from a bone marrow biopsy through lumpectomy, thyroidectomy and anesthesia-free brain surgery. My clients have very pleasant procedure days, no anxiousness and little or no pain.

That said, it is also possible to have a less personalized but still supportive experience by using a guided imagery recording, like those made by Belleruth Naparstek. She has a pleasant voice, and you can download that session for less than $15.
