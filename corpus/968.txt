I agree with you, Rachel was a total slut and a home-wrecker in the show. I thought it was the dumbest thing ever when she went to ruin his marriage with Emily and then tell Ross she loves him while he was still married to Emily. However, Jennifer Aniston didn't ask to write off Helen Baxendale (Emily) off the show, that was part of the story. Since the beginning it was mean to be Ross and Rachel, but they had to make them break-up because that doesn't do much for the story line if they stay together the whole show. So they made them get together, break-up, and then get back together in the end again cuz it was meant to be.
