it's possible that it would still be adrenal disease (not every animal follows the typical timeline of symptoms), but not very likely. have they checked his sugar to make sure it's not insulinoma? weakness of the hind end is a symptom of that, too, and was the first thing my ferret showed when he was diagnosed. if it's not sporadic, and seems to be a permanent thing, it's possible it's an injury as well. were x-rays done?

CBC bloodwork, glucose tests & x-rays should be able to narrow it down for you. it's not cheap to do to all at once, but may be worth it if there is treatment for what's wrong. give the fur-beastie a pat of good luck for me.
