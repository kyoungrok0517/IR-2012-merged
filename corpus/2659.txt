I don't think she needs to tell her parents anything because its only been a few days.  If and when she finds out she is pregnant she can worry about that, if not hope this scares her into shape! Having unprotected sex can lead to a lot more than babies, be sure to tell her that.  She won't know if she is pregnant till she misses her period because even the most sensitive pregnancy tests take at least that long.  Its great that you are such a caring friend but there is no need to worry her parents at this point, but hopefully this serves to scare her straight.
