i GUESS you were born to help people while they are still here on earth. Don't you think you deserve a person who will take good care of you instead. You are a woman and we all know that women should take good care of their husband , but should also taken good care of emotionally, physically and mentally. I've seen my grandma and now my uncle suffered from parkinson's. It is a lifetime ailment and it will never be better but could worsen. Give yourself a break... it is not yet the end of the world for you.. try to wait a little more,.. for the right man for you. I cannot avoid thinking that sometimes it is only pity that are feeling towards your guy.
