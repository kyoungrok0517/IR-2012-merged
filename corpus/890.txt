Traditional Chicken Quesadillas

    * 2 tablespoons oil
    * 1/4 cup onions, chopped
    * 1 small garlic clove, minced
    * 1/4 cup bell peppers, chopped
    * 2 chili peppers (to taste), minced
    * 3 plum tomatoes, chopped
    * oil for frying
    * 8 flour tortillas
    * 2 cups cheddar cheese, shredded
    * 1 1/2 cups cooked chicken
    * salsa
    * sour cream

In a medium-heavy skillet, saute the onions, garlic and peppers until soft in the 2 tablespoons oil. Add the chili peppers and tomatoes and simmer for a few minutes more. Add the chicken and stir well to combine. Heat a thin layer of oil in a heavy medium-size pan over medium-low heat. Place a tortilla in the pan and sprinkle with 1/4 cup cheese. Add about a quarter of the chicken mixture and top with another 1/4 cup cheese. Cover with another tortilla and cook for two to three minutes or until golden brown. Flip the quesadilla over and cook for an additional two minutes. Remove from the heat and cut into wedges. Keep warm while frying the remaining quesadillas. Serve with salsa and sour cream.
