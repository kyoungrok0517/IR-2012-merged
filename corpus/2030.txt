I hadn't heard that one.  However, I would not put it past the Clintons to stretch the truth a bit.

1.  If I am not mistaken, Edmund Hilary spells his last name with one "l".

2.  How many people that you know are named after mountain climbers?  If I have another kid, maybe I'll name him "Sherpa".
