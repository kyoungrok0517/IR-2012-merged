I couldn't find a chart that goes higher than 150W incandescent.  We have floodlights outside the house that are 150W.  I can't imagine reading under a 200W bulb but OK....    The CFL equivalent for 150 W is listed as between 33W to 55 W.  The boxes of CFLs are marked with what incandescents they're equivalent to.  You'll probably have to look in hardware stores to find a CFL with that much wattage.  I've never seen any CFLs that powerful in grocery or drug stores.  Wherever you bought the bulb that you're now using will probably carry CFLs in the same wattage.
