Ok i currntly live in baltimore and have since I was born...Baltimore is a bad place now
They have a lot of kids acting out, they want a parent with you and over 16 becuase sneaking off is horrible. No one can trust you. Not everyone in Baltimore is bad but I kno a few people who took drugs and smoked by the age of 10..Yes unbeiliveable!! But not just in baltimore, many other states.
