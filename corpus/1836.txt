Tips that screw on are for tomato stakes........................depending on the level your hubby plays there are huge amounts of very good cues to purchase...........suggest going to the nicest pool room in your area and speak with the owner re local cue makers or recomending national brand cues they may have to offer.................and the amount of money you're looking to spend..................decent cues start at around 300 and run to 2000 or more.......................pick your poison
