The bigger and brighter the moon, the more the deer will move at night and the less they will move at day. A smallish moon or new moon with some cloud cover will make for a great next day of hunting because if they cant see great that night they will bed up and wait till light to get up and move... The curent moon is near full therefore the deer a mostly moving at night. seeing one right now would require a realllllly cold day or seeing them just before dark or just before day... if its cold nomater how bright the night the deer will be forced to move because they need food to keep up thier body temp.... So bright night deer move at night... Dark night, deer move at day.
