E. The ice comes from gases (CO2 and H2O) in the atmosphere freezing out. Most of the seasonal changes are due to CO2 sublimating and freezing; the H2O ice stays permanently frozen for the most part. A great deal of the ice caps are H2O, not just CO2. The temperature doesn't get high enough to melt the water ice, though.

The question itself is flawed. Mars does have water in the atmosphere in both solid and gaseous form, which freezes out into frost and sometimes even snow. There are ice crystal clouds like cirrus clouds and the atmosphere is practically saturated with water vapor (for all it counts, as the atmosphere is to cold and thin to hold very much of it).
