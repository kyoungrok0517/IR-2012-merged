The answer provided is partially true.  However, we do not use radioactive materials and for the most part gel electrophoresis is not used.  Capillary electrophoresis is used.  These are outdated techniques from a forensic standpoint.  We also do not make a copy of the entire DNA for an individual.  We examine certain areas of interest.  We don't examine areas that tell what color eyes or what color hair someone has.  It is not a copy of the complete genetic profile for a human.  It is possible from one strand of hair to obtain a complete DNA profile from the forensic scientist point of view.  The same is also possible from a stamp .  There are lots of variables, but it may be possible to obtain a complete forensic DNA profile from an item as old as or older than 40 years.
