Wow, those sound spooky. Is your house haunted? It almost sounds like you're being visited from spirits, which they can do a lot easier while you're asleep.

But assuming they're just symbols for stuff going on in your life right now, a face is what people show to the world, so being unable to see it means you are unable or unwilling to look at whatever these people represent and see them for what they are. 

Two people would be something that is coming in pairs and dressed in white would represent innocence or purity. A little girl may represent yourself, your inner child. I'm not sure what significance tartan plaid has for you so you may want to ponder what connections you have.

Your bedroom represents your private thoughts so your inner child is entering your thoughts. A window is an unusual way of entering, so it could be symbolizing that it's not something straightforward. 

You levitating -- wow that's spooky -- but I think the meaning depends on your feelings in the dream. If positive, you have risen above your problems, you are not weighted down by anything, there are very good things. However if you are upset by it, it may mean you are not feeling grounded, you are sort of up in the air about things.

I hope that makes some sense. If not, I think you are being visited!
