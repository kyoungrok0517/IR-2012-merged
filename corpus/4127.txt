But fire is awesome! Would you take the just and loving gods' vengeance away from him just to drink beer off of the ground? (Or out of the volcano, I guess.) Plus, a giant flood of beer would be just as deadly as lava, since the alcohol would kill the plants, and the floods would kill the animals. I don't think a just and loving god would appreciate wasted followers, either.
