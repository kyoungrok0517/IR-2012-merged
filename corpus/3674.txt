I know alot of people ask the question, "Why is life so unfair?" I can't help but wonder the same thing. I think I may be suffering from manic-depression but what sucks most about it is nobody seems to care. I share my theory with my parents but they just dismiss it and say, "You don't have a problem." Why do I have to have this when there are more deserving people out there. Why do I feel despair when others are living the dream.

What puzzles me the most about depression is my guilt for feeling terrible when there are others worse off than me. I can't help thinking about what I don't have going for me: I'm not very attractive at all, I have poor social skills, I can't pay attention, I don't retain any knowledge for long anymore, and I want to be an author but my writing skills are lacking (despite persistant work to improve).

I guess my question is: Why, despite my unwavering belief in God, loyalty to my friends, and dedication to whatever I do, am I subjected to feeling miserable?
