Well, technically that's impossible, according to their cells. But if they did mate together, then yes the 'child' would probably inherit all their parents' traits. It would be an omnivore (eats both meat and plants), be able to live on both land and water, not in salt water though, can't fly, and I imagine it would have an alligator's head with a beaver tail and legs. The only thing that would and COULD hunt them would be a shark or a tiger. seriously, I have no clue. Hope these helped.
