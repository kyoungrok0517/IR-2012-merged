I am recovering from an eating disorder and I have scheduled meals, etc so that I can put on weight - but I would like to also learn to listen to hunger signals.

Of course at the moment it doesn't matter at all in the long run if I eat for a craving as opposed to a hunger pain, because I need to gain weight anyway - but I just want to know the difference.

Could you please describe how you feel physically and mentally when you are hungry or when you have a craving?
