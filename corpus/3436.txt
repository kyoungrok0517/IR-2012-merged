Note: the artists I mention were simply not as appreciated in their own time as they are now...their work wasn't necessarily "hated". 

Vincent van Gogh is probably the most notable case of posthumous fame in the art world, but a few other examples of artists whose work was not fully appreciated during their own lifetimes include:

El Greco: he "was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism." (according to Wikipedia)

Egon Schiele: his work was considered disturbing and grotesque. Though he was supported by Klimt, both his work and his notorious lifestyle were rejected by most members of the art community and the general public.

Henry Darger: an outsider artist whose work wasn't discovered until his death.

Thomas Gainsborough: his career was rough at best (he never sold well), and though he became one of the founding members of the Royal Academy, his relationship with the group was uneasy, to the point where he had to stop exhibiting with them after only five years of membership. Today, however, he is considered one of the greatest painters of the 18th century.
