I just got a recall on a 1998 Dodge Ram Van, 2wd, auto/air, 3.9 V6; Airbag module replacement. 

Be aware in addition to recalls there are Advisories,  Alerts,  Memos,  Notifications,  Service Campaigns, TSBâ€™s [tech service bulletins],  etc, etc.

A Dodge dealer might for free run your VIN vs the above items.
