http://www.parkinson.org  would be a great site for you to check out.   There are forums there where you'd probably get the best info from the people who know best.  As far as your questions go-

1.  When people are first diagnosed, it can be devastating to them.  They may go through quite a range of emotions.  As the disease progresses and they lose motor ability and independence, they must also continue to adjust.  They can have anger issues, anxiety attacks, and more.

2.  The special needs are highly individual, depending on the stage of the degeneration.  You would also need to work closely with their own doctor to determine how best to proceed with dental treatment.  Patients with extreme tremors might need sedation for dental work to even be possible.  Others might be incontinent, and you would certainly want to be sensitive to that.

The site should provide you with most of what you will need.
