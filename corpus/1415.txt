Any painted helmet that uses reflective paint is good, they make helmets that use refllective paint.  Or  you could always buy some retro reflective stickers to put on your helmet (the kind on fire engines and firefighter turnout gear).  
None of this ensures you'll be seen, though.  Riding to attract attention is a great way to be seen and avoided.  For example: when coming up to a stoplight from speed, weave back and forth to let people know you're there while you're slowing down.  Most box jockeys are too busy with their cell phone/mp3 players to worry about actually driving their cars.

Be careful out there.
