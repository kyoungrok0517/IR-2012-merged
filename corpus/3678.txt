If you truly think you do, GET TO A DOCTOR!  My husband has it and was suicidal before they found it. His parents still don't think there's anything wrong with him but I can tell you there is!! What matters is how you feel. Forget everyone else. Take care of you. No matter what it is, if something is not right, you need to start treatment as early as possible before you really mess up your life. Any serious feelings of depression should be taken seriously. In my hubby's case, I think his parents are actually part of the problem!!
