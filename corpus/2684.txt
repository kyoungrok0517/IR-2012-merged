There is absolutely no reason to have it done, but it is your choice and I have nothing against parents who choose to have their boy circumcised. Personally if I was in your position I wouldn't. He can get it done when he is older if he really wants. If he isn't willing to go through that pain when he is older than obviously he can't want it too bad.
