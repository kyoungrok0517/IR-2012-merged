So The Dark Knight is extremely close to beating Titanic in the box office, but if it doesn't what movie will?

Don't get me wrong, Titanic is my all time favorite movie, watched it in theaters the day it came out and I own two box sets.. got them when they first came out! 10 years and its still on top... freakin amazing!

What genre, what topic, remake or original, what producer or director is going to beat it?
