Most cancer cells are very similar to normal cells other than the fact that they continue to grow uncontrollably, where as normal cells have a mechanism which switches off the cell growth cycle. This is one of the reasons that your bodies natural imune system doesn't target and destroy cancerous cells, that is that they look very much like normal cells to your immune system (white blood cells which destroy foreign bodies). 
The cancer cells usuallly have an abnormal nuclei with many chromosomal irregularities. They form tumours and cause nearby blood vessels to form a capillary network that help feed the tumor.

Because cancer cells continue to grow and divide, they are different from normal cells. Instead of dying, they outlive normal cells and continue to form new abnormal cells.

Cancer cells develop because of damage to DNA. This substance is in every cell and directs all activities. Most of the time when DNA becomes damaged the body is able to repair it. In cancer cells, the damaged DNA is not repaired. People can inherit damaged DNA, which accounts for inherited cancers. More often, though, a person's DNA becomes damaged by exposure to something in the environment, like cecal txns, radaton, smoking, etc.
