I don't know if you can hypnotize your friend but self hypnosis might work.  All hypnosis does is give your subconscious mind suggestions to have positive feelings about something.  It can give your friend some suggestions to not be afraid of birds but she would be better off getting a script on fear and reading it into a tape recorder.  That way it is her own voice she can listen to when ever she has some time and it would be her reassuring herself subconsciously that her fear of birds is leaving.  I don't know if your going to find something like that for free or not.
