I would advise you to use the new technique FUE. I had my brother's surgery done at India where the Dr uses a variation of the FUE called the FLUTE technique in which he uses the FUE and FUT technique to their fullest potential. Dr Tejinder Bhatti's technique is pathbreaking in difficult cases where there is a tight scalp. I don't know what is your problem, but FUE should be your first choice followed by FLUTE and last if these are not for you, then you will have to go in for the strip method. FUE grows hair better and faster.
