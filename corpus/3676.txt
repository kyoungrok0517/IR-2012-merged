I'm sorry you're going through all of this, but keep in mind that there are a lot of other people living and dealing with mental illness. You can get through this and lead a healthy and productive life.

You said you think you "may" be manic-depressive. Have you seen a doctor or therapist yet? If not, then go to your family doctor to get a referral for a qualified therapist. Then this person can properly diagnose you and start a treatment plan. Medication can sometimes do wonders for depression and mood disorders.
You can also call 1-800-therapist, which is a free referral service for those looking for a good therapist.

I'm not sure of your age, but if you're still a minor in school then talk to a school counselor or teacher so that they can possibly help you communicate with your parents that you need some help.

Also, you need to stop being so hard on yourself. I know it's easier said than done, but you need to break out of this negative thinking pattern and try to find the things in yourself that are good and positive. Everyone has talents and abilities. Everyone has something to offer and so do you. It just takes practice, but as you work on improving your self-esteem, you'll begin to feel more connected with your life. Depression and manic-depression (bi-polar) can affect concentration and self esteem so once you begin some kind of treatment and get to feel more stable in your life you'll find that such things as social skills and your writing skills will become easier.

Take a look at this link http://www.utexas.edu/student/cmhc/booklets/selfesteem/selfest.html that offers some good advice on improving self esteem. It's pretty good.

People do care and there is help out there for you. Take care
