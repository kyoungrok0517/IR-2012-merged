We hear a lot about CO2 being added to the atmosphere via combustion of fossil fuels and the negative effects of that. What about the release of water via combustion. Does combustion vapor affect weather, climate change, ocean levels, etc.? In addition, we are releasing a great deal of water into the atmosphere by removing ground water for consumption and irrigation.
