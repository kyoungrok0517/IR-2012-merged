Depression has physiological causes, which is why medication helps.  But it also has causes that are rooted in our attitudes and self-statements that we feed ourselves.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy can help reduce depression ... but Buddhism does the same thing more-completely.  I have seen and a firmly convinced that Buddhism operates by the same principles that CB therapy does, but because Buddhism is practiced 24/7 and all experiences are dealt with, it is more effective.

Buddhism will do everything you want.  IF ...
1.  You find a qualified (usually a monk) local teacher
2.  You do what the teacher tells you to do ... every day and as often through the day as you remember to.  Meditation is only half of the practice of Buddhism.  It is easy to learn but hard to do.
3.  You are patient.  Sometimes you don't start to see results for a few years, or 5, or more.  But what else are you going to do with that time anyhow?

Here is a site that lists dharma centers worldwide.  Hopefully there is one near you:

You might be able to forgo #1.  If there is no teacher near you, I highly recommend teaching CD's (or MP3 downloads) by Pema Chodron, especially "Getting Unstuck" and "Don't Bite the Hook".  Also "Awakening Compassion", but as a third choice (all 3 listed under "pema chodron teachings from other sources").  
My sister and I view these teachings as being as good as any medication ... but they take some years to sink in and effect change.  Here's the site for these, although you can often get them second-hand through amazon.com

I hope either of these sources will be useful to you.  Life is mandatory, suffering is optional.
