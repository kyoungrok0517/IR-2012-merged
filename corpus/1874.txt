Induction is when you take a set of particular facts to form a general rule, principle, or conclusion. Example, I walk into my home and the doors open, fact 1, then when I walk around my place I notice some things are gone, fact 2. These "facts" suggest or indicate a conclusion, that my place has been robbed. It's uncertain, because there may be other facts which could alter my conclusion. So if I come to find some friends were playing a practical joke on me, that would change the conclusion, obviously. 

In contrast, deduction is when you take a general rule, principle, conclusion, or definition, to form particular facts. So the classic example of this is the categorical syllogism: "All men are mortal" "Socrates is a man" leads to "Socrates is mortal." "Socrates" belongs to the "category" of "men" and "men" belong to the category of "mortals." It's certain because if the premises are true then the conclusion must also be true. That is, it doesn't add to our knowledge, it merely re-arranges what we already know to be true.
