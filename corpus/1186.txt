I live in Lubbock, TX (Zone 7) and am looking for a very fast growing shade tree with a round shaped canopy to plant in the middle of my front yard. I donâ€™t want a pine or other evergreen. There are no other trees nearby, so it will have full West TX sun. I had a fruitless mulberry tree at my previous house that grew extremely fast, more than 6ft per year for the 2 years I lived there. I thought about planting one at my new house but have been told they can be problematic since they have invasive root systems. Are they as bad as some people claim? I want a tree with similar growth rate but without roots that can cause damage to pipes and concrete. From what I understand, that excludes the Empress tree. Someone told me to plant a cedar elm instead but I have found conflicting growth rates posted online. Can anyone help me find the best tree to fit my needs?
