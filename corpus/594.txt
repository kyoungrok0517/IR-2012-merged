FIRST SORRY ABOUT THIS INCIDENT...............


"If an encounter with a deer is inevitable, then you should hit the brakes up until the very last second of impact; suddenly releasing the brakes will send the deer propelling into the roadway rather than into your windshield." 

"If you spot a deer in the road, slow down immediately and blow your horn with one long blast to frighten it away." 

"Most motorist deaths and injuries occur when drivers swerve to avoid hitting the deer and strike a fixed object, such as a tree or another vehicle. It may seem powerless, but simply applying your brakes while you're buckled up, gripping the steering wheel with both hands, and coming to a controlled stop (if possible) can actually help minimize damage and injuries."

"Be especially attentive from sunset to midnight and during the hours shortly before and after sunrise. These are the highest risk times for deer-vehicle collisions."

"Don't assume there's only one deer crossing the road -- they usually travel in groups."

"When you encounter deer along the roadside, turn on your emergency lights to let other motorists know about the potential danger."
