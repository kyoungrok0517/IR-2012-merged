Greatest football team ever.  Angel of the North.  Some bridge over the Tyne  (no not the Tyne Bridge, the other one that you walk over).  The Gate  (lots of pubs inside a mall).  Friendliest people.  Sexiest accent, nobody can imitate it properly, especilly the mackems.  haven' got the time or the inclination to name them all.  Proud to be a Geordie!!
