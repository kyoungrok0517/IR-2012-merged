I try not to get into the whole end of the world stuff. 

I do believe that we should all be prepared for a war or a natural disaster. I believe that people will be involved in screwing up our world, but not the ending the whole world. In the event we would have to flee our home we know exactly what we are taking, and it what order it needs to be grabbed in case we are limited on time and where we plan to try and get to.

"For many centuries, people have been predicting the year, the month and sometimes the day when:

 A violent and sudden end would terminate all life on earth; 
 Major social and political upheavals would occur around the world; 
 The war of Armageddon would take place in the Middle East; 
 God would pour horrendous wrath on most of humanity; and/or 
 Christ would return in what is referred to as the second coming.   

The prophesiers have almost always predicted that these horrendous events would happen in their own immediate future.

All of these predictions share one factor: none have ever come true.

 

Still more end events are predicted for precise dates our future. 

 Some people in North America devoutly believe that at least some of these events will happen in their lifetime.  
 Others expect that they will happen at some time in the far future. They note that such events have not happened in the 19 or so centuries since the Bible was completed, and so they don't expect them in this century.  
 Many of the public disagree, and does not expect any more that the usual complement of natural disasters in the future, until, of course, the next big asteroid hits." 

 
If the end of the world ever comes and no one will survive there is nothing you can do, so why worry about it?
