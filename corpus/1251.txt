I think the best is Cerato. Kia has improved its cars over the years and people are saying that the interior qualaty is better than a lexus. the hatch is the better option (if your into good looks).  I have a sportage and it hasnt let me down for more than a year. my friend had a cerato sedan.. he liked it alot.
