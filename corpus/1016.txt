Oh, you're gonna have a blast!  They have rock wall climbing, basketball courts, mini golf, great pools & hot tubs, arcade and Adventure Ocean!

Adventure Ocean is a complimentary program of fun and educational activities open to all guests ages 3-17. Children are separated by age: 3 to 5; 6 to 8; 9 to 11; 12 to 14; and 15 to 17. Your child will get to learn about local customs, do cool science experiments, and make great new friends. The 12-14 and 15-17 Adventure Ocean groups allow teens the freedom to come and go as they please for sports, themed parties, movie nights and more. Teens can also meet and relax in the laid-back Living Room lounge, or dance late into the night at Fuel, our teen-only nightclub.
