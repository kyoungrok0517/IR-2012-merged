I don't know if the Uniformed Services Former Spouse Protection Act applies to medical retirement pay.  The USFSPA states that you must have been married to him at least 10 years and he must have had active service of at least 10 years.

But unless the 50% of his retirement pay was specifically granted to you in your final divorce decree, you won't get anything even if all of the above conditions are met.
