Most retirement plans allow you to put money into the plan that has NOT been taxed.  Either this money is subtracted from your W-2 income (employee sponsered retirement plans) or you can take a deduction on your tax return (traditional IRA - note this deduction may be phased out at higher income levels).

When you take this money out of the retirment plan, you are taxed on it at that time.  It has not been double taxed as you did not pay tax on it when the money was originally earned.

You will be charged a penalty to withdraw these funds early.  The penalty is imposed to prevent abuse of the system.  There are a number of exceptions to this penalty (first time homebuyer, education expenses).
