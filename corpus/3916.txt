I had my menstrual period last for more than 10days.I called my doctor and immediately went to see him. He did an outopsy and had me do an ultrasound. Results was that I have too much estrogen,so he prescribed provera. However I've been trying to get pregnant and was in the process of seeing a Fertility Specialist. should I continue going to see the specialist or should I wait till my current process is over?
