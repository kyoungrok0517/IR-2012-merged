Whats there NOT to believe in about 2012? the only thing thats going to happen is that the north and south poles are soposed to shift. They will shift rapidly meaning tsunamis, earthquakes, tornadoes, ect. will be happening. . . . .It has been predicted by some indian lady that there will be terrorist attacks later on in the year..GOOD LUCK! :P..If the poles don't shift rapidly (which is highly unlikely) then in 2012 were going to have the olympics, and presidential elections and we will all live happily ever after :) 

Oh and Justin Bieber DOES in fact have a penis, and Lady Gaga has both a vagina and penis. kbye
