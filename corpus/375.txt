The reason that the lender is not returning your calls is that the lender is not interested in dealing with you directly.  Lenders procure the services of real estate firms to dispose of foreclosed properties.

Why do they do so ?  Because the large lenders such as Countrywide, WaMu, and ABN AMRO lend in all fifty states and just do not want to be bothered with knowing the different real estate laws and practices of fifty different states.  So they hire real estate brokerages in the state where the property is located to handle the work for them.
