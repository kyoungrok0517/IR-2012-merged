No, technically you are underweight, from a bmi point of view - though if you have grown tall relatively recently, it may be a while until you flesh out. The point is, you certainly shouldn't be thinking of losing weight, and if you gain a bit of weight, that would probably be good for you. 18 is "only just" underweight - I was under 20 for some time
