Good one Don, yeah, they sell osmocote that is formulated especially for Orchids. It is usually spread over the top of the potting medium in established plants and a little can be mixed with the potting mix when re potting. I use it mostly with Cymbidiums. You can get it from orchid supply places on line or from e bay. Make sure you get formulations for your needs, there are several types. For general feeding get a balanced one, a 5-5-5 or 10-10-10. Be sure to follow the directions for the amount to use, many people over fertilize thier Orchids.
