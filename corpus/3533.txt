I find the airborne botulism thing to be odd, since it is caused by Clostridium botulinum, which is usually a GI bug. If doesn't usually cause airborne type illness.... 

I could be wrong, but I have a BS and MS in Microbiology, and passed was a PhD candidate when I left the program. I find it dubious that honey was NOT causing the botulism infections....
