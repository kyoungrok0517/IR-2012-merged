NO!!!
I am good friends with a dermatologist and she always tells me if you want a tan the safest way to do it is a little bit at a time in the Sun.

The danger in tanning beds is that the lights/radiaton they use is a lot stronger than the sun. So It is like your skin is being exposed to a HIGHER dosage of sun than if you were  just to be outside. In a tanning bed it only takes 8 minutes to get the damage of sun you would get in 2 hours of direct sunlight. 

Also it is important to be exposed to direct sunlight for about 15 minutes because that is the way your body naturally produces Vitamin D through V-D synthesis through your skin. 

So if you get burend easily try this:
Lay out in the Sun for 40 minutes a day, with 15 SPF sunsceen on of course, for about 4 days until you get a "base" tan which means your body already produced a certain amount of melanin. Then you  can go out in the sun for longer periods of time (WITH at least 30 SPF SUNSCREEN ON OF COURSE) with a smaller risk of getting a burn.

You have to let the Melanin build in your skin over time, not in one day so that it can protect your skin. The Sun in small amounts is good for you and your skin is your natural defense to UV exposure so protect it. So be smart and wear sunscreen and don't go to tanning beds because going to a tanning bed is like PAYING FOR SKIN CANCER and after a few years your skin will get leathery and get ugly sunspots which will not go away.
