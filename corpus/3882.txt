Radiography and ultrasound are BOTH excellent fields , and you really can't go wrong either way in terms of demand....the deciding factor here really is the money.

Ultrasound is much higher pay-wise  , infact  ultrasound ( and Nuc med) are the highest paid in imaging...ultrasound for being the most skilled  , and Nuc med for having the highest risk. Ultrasound isn;t easy...it's 100% operator dependent. YOU control everything from where the beam goes to the intensity, to the compression of the soundwaves. There is a a whole registry in physics you will need to pass...of course , learning the physics is part of your program. like I said ...it doesn't come easy to everyone . Most classes strt out with 20 students , and graduate with less than half that number. 

X-ray typically starts anywhere from 14 to 18 per hour . Ultrasound starting pay is between 24 and 26 per hour nationally and goes up dependent upon the experience level , and number of registries held the the sonographer.

it really depends on you ....money isn't everything . What would YOU be most happy doing  Both have direct patient care , both have the benifits of a solid in-demand career. many people start out x-ray and do ultrasound  later . It's all a personal choice .

I wish you luck either way :-)

ardms.org has listings of accredited ultrasound programs state by state. Don't waste money on an unrecognized program. un-accredited program = NOT registry eligable. That means NO JOB. don;t get scammed by a non-acredited school out for your money.
