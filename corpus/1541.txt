Don't forget, Mariano Rivera's number has actually already been retired.

Since they only need at most 45 numbers (40 players and 5 coaches) out of 100 numbers they still have a ways to go.  They've retired 14 numbers.  Even if they retired Jeter, A-Rod, Posada, Bernie, O'Neill, Pettitte, Torre, etc, they'll still have 79 or so numbers too come up with the 45 they need.  I don't think it's anything our generation needs to worry about.
