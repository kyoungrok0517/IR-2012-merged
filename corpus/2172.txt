It may grow back if you get your TSH to around 1.0.  If it does not, then its quite possible you need both T4 and T3. That was the case for me. Once I got on Armour gettin my Free T4 midrange and my Free T3 high in range the hairloss stopped. It helped with most of my other hypo symptoms as well.

Also, sometimes Synthroid causes hairloss. If its severe and you are on this med, you may want to think about switching to something else
