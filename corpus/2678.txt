If she is not local, you need to talk to her and make her understand she can depend on you but she CAN'T ask you to take the place of the guy who may have gotten her pregnent. SHE needs to do the right thing. She must tell her parents and the guy. She needs to relax, see if she is pregnant, and then make these decisions. Until then she is wracking her brain and yours. Tell her to take a test, after the test talk to the guy and see what he will do.....Let her also understand it is her problem and you willbe there if he is not but you can't be the replacement or her confidant if she is not willing to face the problem honestly if she is pregnant. THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT HER PREGNANT STATUS IS.  You are right, you are her friend and she has family and needs to deal with this with them......You sound like a great guy.
