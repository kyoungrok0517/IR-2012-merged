$85,000.00 sounds very low. It does not compute out. If you work for the next 35 years and make full contributions I would think your number should be much higher. $85K in 35 years won't buy you much retirement comfort. Are you calculating the earnings or just your anticipated contributions?

How much are you putting in each year? What is it invested in?
