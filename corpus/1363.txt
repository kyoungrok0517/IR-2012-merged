My grandma and mom have bone issues and so I'm trying to take as much calcium now so that when i get to be their age I wont have those problems. Anyway I went to the store and they had like 20 different kinds of calcium.  Everything from Calcium & Cod Liver Oil to Calcium Vitamin D. Very confusing.  What should I get?
