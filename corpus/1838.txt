as an owner of three cues, the cheapest being $150 and the most expensive being $2,000,   the screw on tips are cheap to replace but do not have the quality in their substances.  quality tips can cost up to15.00 a piece depending on the quality of the leather they are made of and the layers in their composition.    next u have to consider the ferule that the tip is mounted on.   the bad thing about the screw on tips is that they can back out or loosen, causing a miss cueing or shot deflection and then mess up the threads which leads to a new ferule and tip replacement.   i strongly suggest you check with mueller recreational products at www.pooldarts.com or get their free catalog to see the difference between the cues, ferules, tips, types of wraps,  types of woods use to make the cues and just get a better understanding that the equipment one uses has a great effect on the game.  hope this helps you and your husband.
