In my mind art should not have borders.
Addit. A.A. I am sorry you feel this way but I am of the belief we should have the right to choose what we go to see,read and be involved in.
Of course there are instances were censorship is appropriate but I only seen this as being in cases of gratuitous violence and sex,pedophilia and the promotion of drugs and alcohol.
