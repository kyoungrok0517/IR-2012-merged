Most creative Halloween costume ever? Difficult to say, really. After all, with all the various costume parties over the years, and the millions of trick-or-treaters also over the years, folks have probably claimed hundreds of people each Halloween have had the most creative ever. But then that's an impossibility as it proclaims that in years to come there will never be any costumes to top all the costumes for a given year that are viewed as such.

All that aside, some party stores might have a limited supply of Halloween costume accesories still on the shelves (wigs, makeup, hats, props, hairspray, that type of thing; don't expect full costumes). However, Halloween costumes at this time are going to be a bit harder to come up with, so you'll certainly want to be looking at making a costume. Fabric stores, and department stores where they sell fabric and sewing supplies should have some catalogs that have costume patterns in them (their strict costume catalogs won't be out for a while yet, but those catalogs that do have a costume section in them should be something like 1/8 to 1/4 the number of costumes in the Halloween costume catalog; think McCalls and Simplicity are what you want to try). Those should give you some ideas. 

Also think about movies, movie series, novels, and comics. One of my sisters went to a party about two or three years ago in late June/early-mid July where the theme was Star Wars and everyone was supposed to dress up as a Star Wars themed character. I'm sure there are Harry Potter themed parties out there. As well as others like Star Trek, comic heroes and villians, etc. Things that some might see as more of a Halloween thing, others as a geek/nerd thing. But their certainly good for summer.

Also, try checking some Halloween websites for costume ideas. They'll give you some ideas.
