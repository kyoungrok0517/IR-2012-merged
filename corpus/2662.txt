Well I don't really know why you are so worked up yet if you don't even know if she is pregnant yet. I think that you should really have her take a pregnancy test first before you do anything else. If she is pregnant there is nothing you really can say but congrats, and if she isnt then you need to tell her if she ever goes out and parties like that again she needs to think whether she wants to go through this scare again. On the other hand about her talking to her parents maybe she should wait till she knows I think that would make her talk to them even if she doesn't want to now. When I got pregnant with my second baby I didn't want to tell my mom cause I knew she would get mad. I was about 4 1/2 months when she finally saw my belly. She was so hurt for me not telling her to begin with that I felt so terrible for a while. And I couldn't even look at her.. In your friends best interest I would have told my mom if I knew how she would feel. Plus now she is like my best friend
