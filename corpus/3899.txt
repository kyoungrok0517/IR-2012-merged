If you are good at GCSE maths (particularly things like trig and algebra) then you should be OK with A level physics.  Much of this level of physics is expressed using equations, and so they need to be used and rearranged and if you struggle with maths this would be hard.  Ask a physics teacher for some example equations and see if you are able to rearrange them as this will be a good indicator.

There is also an overlap with physics and certain maths courses which is also why maths is recommended to go with physics.
