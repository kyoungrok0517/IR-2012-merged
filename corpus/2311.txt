Smoking can affect your health in two ways:
1) The poison can change the way the cells in your body works so that you develop different kinds of cancers or auto-immune responses (your body attacks itself because of the cell changes).  These diseases are not infectious because they are not the result of viruses or bacteria (which is what infectious diseases are all about).

2) Smoking lowers your immune system, which means that your body cannot fight the viruses or bacteria effectively - even though these diseases are infectious, non-smokers generally have stronger immune systems, which means that they don't get sick even if they are exposed to the bugs that cause the illness.
