i have been researching terrariums for a while and i got a lot of info but i never saw anything about if dart frogs will eat freeze dried or those pre-killed in a gel crickets. would anyone know if i can feed to them using big tweezers or a vibrating dish?
also can anoles and dart frogs live in the same terrarium? some places say yes some say no. i could really use some help.
