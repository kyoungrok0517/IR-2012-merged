I usually go as tight as possible by hand (I'm sure you could go tighter with more leverage). Hopefully your joint doesn't bind up if you crank on it a lot, but you want to make sure there's solid contact between the shaft and the butt. If there's not, then sideways impact to the shaft (like shooting a hard shot with english) will put extra stress at the collar with potential for cracking. Also, the tighter the joint, the less vibration the shaft will have and the better feel you can get for the ball. I haven't played with any cues that have a 'click' when you screw them together.
