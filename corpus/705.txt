How should we know?  Height means nothing, since they dont' go by height.  Is your dog a standard or a mini or something inbetween?  What does your vet say?

edit:  The standard for the Dachshund, according to the Dachshund Club of America is  http://www.dachshund-dca.org:

Standard 16-32 pds by 1 yr
Mini 6-11 pds by 1 year

There is no height listed.  So if your dog is a Standard, then 18 pounds is fine.
