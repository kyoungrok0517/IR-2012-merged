TMJ is the term for the joint. TMD is temporomandibular disorder, which means that you are having problems with that joint (just like you can have problems with any other joint).

The dentist would usually recommend a nightguard to help maintain your jaw in the correct position, or for severe cases, surgery may be necessary.
