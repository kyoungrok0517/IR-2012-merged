We all know about the "Mozart Effect", which a lot of people translate as "Classical music makes you smarter". I've found that is doesn't necessarily increase my intelligence, but it does (weirdly) enhance my memory, allow me to imagine things more clearly, perceive myself and my environment better, allow me to formulate thoughts better, and I literally feel my brain getting more organized and efficient. Here's the problem though: I'll always have a respect (and love) for classical music, but there's a time when our tastes are a bit harder. I'm pretty sure that processing weird and unusual sounds has the same effect, as it is complex, unnatural to the ear, and literally forces our brain to fire unused neurons to process the information. I believe that listening to EDM could fight schizophrenia, dementia, and alzheimers..  

Now before people start talking about the joys of *mainstream* hip-hop and pop, I wanted to clarify. I'm talking about sounds and songs that push the envelope. Hearing supersaws or the *same effect* for Autotune will probably not do it, because our brains recognize the sound after time and the connections are already formed.

I believe that certain styles of trance, freeform, and other kinds of dance music would work. Like this:

Tell me what you think. Am I on to something here or just a rave nut (the latter would be ok too :) )
@Targus: Fair Enough

@a_phantoms_rose: My bad, your wish is my command haha. Here you go. This should work.
