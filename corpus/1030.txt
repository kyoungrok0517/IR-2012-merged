Are they the ones who use Iggy Pop's "Lust for Life"? That one is about heroin addiction, even though it does sound pretty happy. 

Here comes johnny yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And the flesh machine
He's gonna do another strip tease.
Hey man, where'd ya get that lotion?
I've been hurting since i've bought the gimmick
About something called love
Yeah, something called love.
Well, that's like hypnotizing chickens.

Well, i'm just a modern guy
Of course, i've had it in the ear before.
I have a lust for life
'cause of a lust for life.

I'm worth a million in prizes
With my torture film
Drive a gto
Wear a uniform
All on a government loan.
I'm worth a million in prizes
Yeah, i'm through with sleeping on the sidewalk
No more beating my brains
No more beating my brains
With liquor and drugs
With liquor and drugs.

Well, i'm just a modern guy
Of course, i've had it in my ear before
Well, i've a lust for life (lust for life)
'cause of a lust for life (lust for life, oooo)
I got a lust for life (oooo)
Got a lust for life (oooo)
