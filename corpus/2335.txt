Thunderstorms develop in warm, moist air in advance of eastward-moving cold fronts. These thunderstorms often produce large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. Tornadoes in the winter and early spring are often associated with strong, frontal systems that form in the Central States and move east. Occasionally, large outbreaks of tornadoes occur with this type of weather pattern. Several states may be affected by numerous severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.  During the Summer months Tornadoes mostly form in an area called "Tornado Alley".  This involves colder, dry air coming down from the North, mixing with the hot, moist Gulf Air that moves up from the sun.  The Tornadoes get their initial rotation from the Earth's Coriolis Force.
