I had a baby 6 months ago, so the hair loss I was told could be because of that.....However I've also noticed that I become extremely tired within hrs. of getting out of bed, the joint pain comes and goes, but has gotten worse over the past few weeks, it's primarily in my knees, fingers, toes, and wrists. I've also noticed some weakness, my noticed my knee will just give out and buckle or my wrist and fingers won't let me pick things up. Someone told me it could be Lime Disease, but there is no rash. Any ideas? I know it could be a quincidece that these are all happening at onc, but it's kidda scaring me.
Apparently it's caused my ability to spell to malfunction as well, sorry about that.
