Sorry Ameya,
There is very very little hydrogen in the atmosphere.
Also oxidation is not truly a spontaneous reaction, the compressed gasoline vapors and air compressed in an internal combustion engine need a spark to start the reaction.  This is called ignition.  Try looking up ignition in an encyclopedia.
