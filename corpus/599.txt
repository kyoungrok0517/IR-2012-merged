you should adjust your speed first if you see a sign like that, and be aware while driving, then if a deer would get in front of your car and if you decide you want to avoid it brake first then steer towards the backside of the deer. and pray... lol
the problem with large animals is that if you hit them straight on the chance exists that you get them true the windshield and on to you or your passenger. and if they have deerhorn, well good luck with that.
