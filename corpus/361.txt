Your question is different from your explanation.  Each scenario will have different outcomes in foreclosure.  Only an attorney or a title company in your state can give you a definitive answer on this one.  Be careful!  You can get into a real mess if this foreclosure isn't handled properly and/or you don't know exactly what your rights and responsibilities are before you decide whether to buy the seond lien.  In some states, a second lienholder can only foreclose on a property by paying off the first lien and all tax liens of record.  Then he moves into first lien and will sell the property usually at fair market value, and pocket any money over and above the amount owed on this originally second lien.  The 2nd lienholder is not required to explain your legal position after foreclosure and is not looking out for anyone buy itself.  Find a real estate attorney in the yellow pages who advertises free initial consultation.  Then pay for a legal review of the transaction.  It will be money well spent.  I hope it goes well for you.
