All of those products are just gimmicks to suck in unsuspecting people like you.  That's why they make so much money.  The only way you can truly get rid of scars is plastic surgery.  Good luck
edit One person said laser surgery.  I don't know if I would trust that, but then again, I never looked into it either.  Before you do anything, take time to look into your options before you decide.  Don't rush into the first doctor who tell you what you should do.  Always, always get more than one opinion.
