The IUCN is definitely a good source.  I would also try the World Wildlife Fund as they fund a lot of conservation projects.  The whole movement can be relatively disorganized.  Something you should keep in mind is that there is not a lot of data on most endangered species.  That requires decades of constant field research, which is rare except for the most prominent flagship species.  I would try to focus on a particular species, if you can, and then make generalizations and find research regarding the broader scale.  Primates, such as gorillas, have been researched for years.  I would also try any African large mammal.  Here is the IUCN red list website.  Note how most of the trends are unknown.  http://www.iucnredlist.org/search  Good luck.  Go to the primary resources and journal publications.
