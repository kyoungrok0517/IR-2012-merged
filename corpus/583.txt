Everyone's first gut reaction is to swerve too miss the deer.  But the correct thing to do is hit the brakes and hold the car straight on. While chances are, the deer will not move, the likely hood of the deer coming into the car with you are slim.  The chances of you walking away from a head on with a tree are even slimmer.  

I used to be on a volunteer fire department as a firefighter/emt out in a small country town where this is very common, and I lost count of how many people where serverely injuried or died trying to miss a deer.  I hope this helps with your question.
