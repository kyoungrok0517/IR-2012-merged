A314 absolutely does work.  However, it's not made by Love Scent.  Love Scent sells a selection of good pheromone products from various legitimate vendors.  In other words, one of the best ways to keep from getting scammed is to only buy from the manufacturers Love Scent chooses to stock products from....as they do a very good job of screening out bad products from what they stock.  However, the company that makes A314, Androtics Direct make a whole bunch of great pheromone products, most of which aren't carried by Love Scent.

Androtics Direct also maintains the Pherotalk Forum.  There are a rather large number of people who post on that forum, describing their experiences with various pheromone products. It's probably the best source of information there is on these things, straight from the people who use them.  The sticky posts at the top of the forums are particularly useful in explaining which pheromones do what.

For example, A314 is a GREAT product for increasing the respect and "alphaness" both men and women afford you.  It is extremely effective for that purpose.

Also, Androtics Direct has a great method of allowing people to try their products.  They basically give you $25 towards any of their products if you simply log into the forum and introduce yourself.  They never spam people or engage in any other balogna either.  The company is extremely reputable and goes out of its way in the service area of their business.  That's enough to get a couple of small "togo" bottles of one or two of their products, for free, and test them out for yourself.  A rather elegant answer to the most common question new pheromone users have...."does this stuff work"?  Well, see for yourself for only a couple dollars for shipping.  Why do they do this?  Because their products work....VERY well.  They know they will more than make up for that free product they give out, in future sales.
