ok I have a toad (like from are back yard) and I just got 2 fire belly frogs. Can they live together? It is going ok I right now but the toad is bigger and is eating all the crickets before the frogs can get to them. Other than that things seem to be ok between them. Any good web sites for info about them would be great. thanks
I think everyone is right and the toad is going to find another home by a nice pond down the road from me
