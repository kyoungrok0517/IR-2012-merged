It sounds like she wants you to be a friend, which is all you should be rite now, maybe offer to go with her when she tells her parents, this is a hard thing to do, it would be really noce if you could be there for her, however it is not your responsibility and you dont have to do anything. Just be there for her to have a cry to and a hug, tell her what you think, if its what she wants
