I wouldn't do it, but it will work.

You need to cook tarte tatin at a fairly high temp in order for your puff pastry to rise and a non stick pan isn't ideal.  Doing this will also shorten the life of your pan.

If you go to a walmart, you will be able to get a 12" cast iron pan for under 20$ and it will literally last you a lifetime.  They are the best and most durable multi purpose pan out there.

Good luck with which ever you choose!

Hope this helps!
