Purchasing a cue for your husband is a great idea but it's a purchase that is waaaaaaaaaaaaay more important than something like a house or a car. I'm sure you want it to be a surprise but you're going to have to let him in on what you're doing. 

A high quality cue is going to have a tip that is glued on. Tips are like tires on a car. They wear out with use but the better the tire, the better the ride.

Call your local billiards hall or wherever it is that your husband plays and ask somebody that shoots frequently with your husband what kind of stick he likes. TELL WHOEVER YOU TALK TO WHAT YOUR BUDGET IS. Prices for a cue can start at $19.99 (Wal Mart) and go as high as $2,000.00.

Does he like a 18, 18.5, 19, 19.5, 20, 20.5, or 21 ounce cue. Does he shoot hard or soft (that helps determine what type tip the cue should have)? Does he have a preference to what brand he likes? Does he like a thick, thin, or thinner shaft? Does he like a screw joint or a slip joint for assembling the cue?

It's a lot of information you'll need to have if you want this to be a real surprise but if you have to let him in on it to make your purchase, then so be it. Believe me, if you can't keep it from him, this is going to be the one gift in life that genuinely means "it's the thought that counts".
