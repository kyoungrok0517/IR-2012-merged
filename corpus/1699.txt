I don't think it  indicates infection, I think it is from having to have your mouth open for so long while having other procedures done. It has put added stress on the joint and maybe some inflamation is getting in the joint. I would try some advil for the pain and it also helps get rid of inflamation. Give it some time to get better from all the work you have had done on your mouth and if it does not improve in a few weeks go see your dentist or oral surgeon.
