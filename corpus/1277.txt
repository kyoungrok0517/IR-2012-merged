O.K...Now this is just too high tech for me to believe. I work at a kiosk in the mall on the weekends, for a company that explains the whole change over to converter boxes from analog.  I'm here from 12-8 p.m and all of a sudden because some jack ass kept shutting down the booth early on weekdays, we have to setup this miniature computer with supposed GPS tracking on it, to clock in and clock out everyday. 

First of all, nobody ever comes to this damn booth, unless they want to know where the bathroom is or some other high end store. Most people already have cable boxes and satellite t.v, so my job pretty much requires me to sit on my @ss for 6-8 hours and do nothing, except watch people shop.  Anywho, I'm tired of setting up all of this equipment, and a damn computer now. I'm used to signing in and out on a piece of paper like before. Is it possible for someone to really track where you are, if you email them your time?
