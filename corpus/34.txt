i have an abyssinian bengal named sasha and she is 2 and i think the reason why those breeds don't cause allergies is because they have really short fur that isn't prickly which sounds kind of odd but i'm telling the truth. plus she barely sheds. they are great cats. i think you should just look for short haired cats and your mother will be allergy free!
