Sorry to tell you but there is no such thing as a "Xbox 360 Code Generator"
-They are INDEED all VIRUSES

To get a code Microsoft must make the card, deactivate it, and ship it to any store that sells them. until reactivated they are basically USELESS. 
-That's why when you get a card the cashier swipes it in a machine. That machine activates it and then the card is able to be used

Code Generators Do NONE OF THESE THINGS
