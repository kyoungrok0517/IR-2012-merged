No. It was one of Scotland's grievances under the Stuarts that their trade with the continental nations, France and the Netherlands especially, was disrupted by England's wars. Until 1707 despite having the same king, Scotland and England actually had different foreign policies. Scotland had always regarded France and the Netherlands as essential trading partners, along with the Baltic states, including the Scandinavian nations, the Hanseatic Ports of Germany, Poland and Russia. Despite the Stuart belief in the Divine Right of Kings in practise they were still constrained by the Parliaments of both England and Scotland and although they took a considerable personal role in foreign policy it was never entirely theirs to make.
During the Regency of the Queen Mother Mary of Guise Scotland was effectively a protectorate of France. She even had French troops including elite cavalry to support her, and could call on the French navy to deal with Protestant rebels like John Knox. There is a part of Edinburgh still called Little France.
The closest Scotland came to having a foreign enemy was when the colony of Darien was set up on the Panamanian Isthmus. The Spanish lost no time in closing that down.
Ireland never had a government of its own for anyone to be at war with. Since the time of Edward I Ireland's fate was very much in the hands of the English King.
