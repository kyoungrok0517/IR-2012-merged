Uniforms in schools would be good. Uniforms eliminates distractions from the school, It reduces violence and saves parents money. There are schools that have a uniform of dark pants and whites shirts. You do not have to spend a lot of money to get a white shirt.
 Does the first amendment  say you can wear anything at any time? If so why can't you wear anything you want to school like a swimsuit or your football uniform?
