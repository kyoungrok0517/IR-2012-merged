I think it is a great idea. The kids are there to learn - to get an education. Not a fashion show, not a Victoria's Secret show.  

Without having to focus on what everyone is wearing - they may actually focus on what they are there for.

As for paying for more stuff - I am quite sure that any uniforms I would have to buy would be FAR less than the $50 jeans and $100 shoes that she needs to have to keep up with her friends!
