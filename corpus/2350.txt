I would agree with you when you say that tornadoes often form in areas that are rural because they need moisture to fuel themselves. However, they can form anywhere where there is moisture and a thunderstorm. I live outside of a large city myself and there was once a tornado that struck a few miles away from here. 

So yes, tornadoes can form in crowded cities. Not as likely as rural areas though.
