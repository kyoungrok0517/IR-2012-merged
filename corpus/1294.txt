Consider spending some time in Virginia City.  Wonderful WIld West themed town.  Reno also has some really good live theatre - See if the Bruka has anything happening.

For casinos, try Peppermill if you like Video Poker.  The house profit margins on payout are exceptionally slim (98-99% for casual players playing the basic strategies on 25 cents and up) and the sportsbook is a dream come true.  I'm spolied on it.

Enjoy yourself.  I'm jealous of you and wish I was there :-)
