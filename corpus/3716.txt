Neither.  I'd call it boredom.  You seem like a nice person.  You should find yourself a good hobby... one that doesn't deal with the meaning of life.  Besides, what are you going to "discover" in your lifetime that will do you any good?  You can dwell on it and reach conclusions that you are comfortable with.... you can learn what others have concluded before you.... but in the end it's plain and simple.  No one knows for sure.  In my opinion, you are better off sitting back and enjoying the ride.
