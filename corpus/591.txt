Lots of variables but in that case..lots of trees..40 mph..deer...   also depends on vehicle for me too.. i would just hit it, i know alot of people that swerve when a rabbit or whatever darts out but i dont.. i know its a livin creature but its not worth wrecking my pickup and/or killing someone for a rabbit..same with deer..
