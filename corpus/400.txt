At one point Moses was before God for forty days on the mountain.  Moses also wrote Genesis-Deuteronomy and some say possibly the book of Job.  He was a shepard for forty years before he led the Israelites out of Egypt.  So anything that was historical for him he could have written before the great escape from Egypt.
