My opinion is, they obviously don't test new vehicles rigorously enough.  Most recalls are related to electrical/mechanical wear and tear.  They could find these problems out if they just tested the vehicles for longer durations (more hours and more miles).  The proof is in the pudding.  When a particular model of vehicle has a cronically defective transmission, for example, that lasts 5-10k miles, in the case of the Kia Sedona minivan.  This shows how lightly vehicles are tested before they're put on the market.  

I think it's pretty rediculous to pay tens of thousands of dollars to get a flawed vehicle that has to be recalled because some aspect of the vehicle is deemed unsafe.
