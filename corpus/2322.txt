It takes a special type of thunderstorm to produce a tornado. These storms are called supercell thunderstorms. Supercells will often have storm scale rotation which is called mesocyclone. It is known that there is air underneath the storm that is rotating horizontally. When the updraft of the storm strengthens, with the help of inflow winds, the horizontal rotating air can be tilted into the vertical. If the rotation is strong enough, a lowering from the base of the storm cloud can form and make a wall cloud. Sometimes, the wall cloud can be rotating as well.If the updraft, downdraft, and rear flank downdraft are present, this can strengthen the rotation and can create a funnel cloud. If the rotation remains strong and eventually reaches the ground, then a tornado has formed.

Tornadoes usually die out or dissipate once the RFD (rear flank downdraft) has completely cut off the inflow winds. The presence of a strong downdraft also indicates that the parent storm is also in the dissipating stage.
