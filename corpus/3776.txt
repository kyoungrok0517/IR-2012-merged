childhood obesity. tragic situation, there needs to be more info and discussion about it. not fair to kids to get that kind of a rought start in life. 
post traumatic stress disorder is also a good topic, especially with so many soldiers coming home with it now. 
oh dear, now i can't decide. 
go for the childhood obesity. terrible stigma for the kids, terrible way to grow up.
