I don't have a food processor, so will a blender suffice. 
Also I dont have the right type of pan to be able to put the pastry on top while the apples are cooking.  Am I able to cook the pastry in the oven in a pie tin and then when the apples are cooked put them with the pastry and refridgerate it. 
Thanks for all your help.
