There is only two things that will cause this problem.One the washer sprayer is clogged with dirt or bugs that have hit the sprayer while driving and needs to be cleaned.Two a washer fluid leak from the plastic hose going to the left side.You should turn the washer on and see if you see fluid leaking around the cowl panel.If you see a leak there you will need to remove the cowl panel and replace the hose.Best of luck.
