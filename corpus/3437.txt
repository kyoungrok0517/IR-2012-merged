The truth is even really good aritsts, great artist, only make enough to "get by" in their lifetimes.  Meanwhile the souless robber pirates on Wall Street ruin our country and get million dollar bonuses.  Well, you sell your soul in this lifetime and pay the price afterwards.  If you want someone who came near to being hated during their lifetimes try Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo who were communist sympathizers at a very unpopular time in history.  Google it - you'll find all you need to know.
