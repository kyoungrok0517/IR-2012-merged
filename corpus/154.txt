The end times prophecies of the Bible are just as deluded as the end times prophecies of those who believe that the Mayans predicted the end of the world as 2012 (which they didn't, by the way). Also just as deluded as the blithering idiot who thinks we're going to be walloped by a brown dwarf STAR!.

There have been hundreds of 'supernatural' and superstitious predictions about the the end of the world throughout the centuries and they all have one thing in common...they've all been wrong.
