You can usually only buy steroids from guys at the gym that keep things "hush hush" since steroids are illegal.

And for good reason. Steroids increase testosterone and therefore also increase estrogen which can have negative effects on men such as the growth of female breast tissue, the shrinkage of testicles and the development of excessive acne.

In addition, steroids cause a dependency issue so that when you stop taking them, your body is no longer able to make/regulate its hormones properly. Steroids also cause unnecessary rage and mood swings.

Basically, steroids are a mess and do not help your husband get steroids. You'll be doing both yourselves a disservice.

Go to your local Indigo (or bookstore) and pick up a book called Maximum Muscle. It was written by Men's Health Magazine and it contains an interesting study that put a group of men on steroids up against a group of men who followed a very strict regimen of diet and resistance training. The group WITHOUT steroids had 10% better results than the group on steroids after only a few months. I own this book myself and I love it - its packed full of great advice and training tips that have helped me out a lot.

The book will show your husband this exercise plan with hundreds of pictures and techniques and will give advice on other supplements that can help without damaging his health and/or your relationship.

If you INSIST on hormone supplements, visit a GNC or nutrition store and look for natural testosterone boosters.

Best wishes.
