With pancreatic cancer there are no real sign until its basically too late.  I read that 30,600 people were expected to be diagnosed with it in that specific year(can't remember what year it was) and that 30,000 would die from it in that same year.  It is basically a death sentence.  90% of people die from it within 5 years.  Smoking is the #1 cause.
