My husband & I, play a lot of pool & I was wondering if any one could recommend a good pool cue for me to get. My husband plays with a Predator with a 314 shaft & he seems to really like it, i enjoy using it too. So now,  Im interested in investing in a good pool cue for me now! :) Any one have any good suggestions?
