I was wondering if any of you had any tips or websites/books that I could check out on how to draw in a style not unlike the 36 views of Mount Fuji but that is just an example.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-six_Views_of_Mount_Fuji_%28Hokusai%29

I really admire this Japanese style of art and wanted some tips, suggestions.

Thanks!
