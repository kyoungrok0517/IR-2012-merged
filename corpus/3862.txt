Most people are down on unions because, while they had their purpose in another time, they have deteriorated into thugs and thieves, protecting bad employees, and enriching the union bosses.  Unions did have a part in all the benefits listed above, but they also played a large part in businesses and manufacturers seeking affordable labor outside the US.  Businesses exist to make a profit for their shareholders, many of them union pension funds, not to provide jobs, health insurance, or any other perk.  Unions exist now, to extort as much money from corporations and businesses as possible in exchange for the minimum amount of effort.  Most enterprises would prosper, as would employees, if unions were gone.  They are as past their time as the dinosaurs.
