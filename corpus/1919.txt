The Norse (the people who went viking - "viking" is technically an activity) often settled in places they first visited on raids and Scotland was no different.  There are Norse archeological finds all over Scotland.  The Norse added quite a few words to both Gaelic and Scots.  They also intermarried with the local population - the BBC series "Blood of the Vikings" (and the book by the same title) was about the genetic markers that identify the decendents of the Norse in the British Isles.
