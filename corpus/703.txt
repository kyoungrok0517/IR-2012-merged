My Dachshund (wiener dog) Lucky Is 24'' Long, 9'' Tall, And He weighs 18 pounds, he is male... is he overweight? if so what should i do to help him trim down to a healthy weight?? I've tried making him run around and play, and take him on walks but nothing seems to work.
He's a standard Dachshund (wiener dog)
