they would hunt the things that the alligator hunts and build like beavers they probably get hunted by larger alligators because my pet beagator is only 6 feet and is 10 years old they would live in the water and they would live in the house they made from wood yes my pet beagator lives in the swamp but at night I pick him up and put him in my pool he eats meat and vegetables
