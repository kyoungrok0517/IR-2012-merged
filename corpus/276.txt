Ya - it's OK probably to drink Sunny D while you fast - obviously the kind without sugar.  Water is always better though.  But fasting is a little boring, so it's nice to have some fake sweetener.  You might also think of making a cup of bullion when you get terribly hungry and that takes the edge off.  Try fasting for 10 days - it's not really that hard, but the first few days are sometimes kind of hard.  

Good luck.  How much weight?  Maybe 1.5 lbs a day maximum.
