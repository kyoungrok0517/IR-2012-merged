If you've got just a bit of patience, and want to make some phone calls, I am betting that one turns up at your local shelter.  More and more people are adopting them, more and more uneducated people are breeding them - and the end result is that people buy them for their stunning coats without researching the breed.  Then off to the shelter they go.  I've seen a number of them as I'm in the shelters evaluating Siamese (I volunteer for a Siamese Rescue).
