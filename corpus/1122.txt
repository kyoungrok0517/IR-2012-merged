You always hear about people comparing Babe Ruth to other great baseball players, but not great athletes in other sports like Michael Jordan, Muhammad Ali, Tiger Woods, Jim Brown, Wayne Gretzky, David Beckham. Do you think Babe Ruth was superior in both athletics and popularity or was he inferior in those categories compared to those guys?If you don't think Babe Ruth is the best, then who do you think is the best and the most popular athlete of all time?
