The first poster is right, but there were two other factors:

1. Attempts to exterminate or at least kill the rats that were spreading the plague.

2. Washing with clean water.  We take washing and bathing for granted as part of basic hygiene, but prior to the second rise of the plague, washing was considered unhealthy.  

Oddly, despite being a spreader himself of religious nonsense and "predictions", it was Nostradamus who thought of and actively promoted these two basic ideas which prevented the plague from ever being that deadly again.  It wasn't Nostradamus' dumbass "predictions" that led to him being labelled a "witch" by some idiots, it was his common-sense approach to disease.

If you want links, look 'em up yourself.  You've told you what you need to know, now do the footwork and back it up.
