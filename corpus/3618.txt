Don't go on a sunbed!! Their really dangerous!! Would you rather have healthy white skin, or brown skin with cancer!?
Maybe you should try a higher factor of sun cream. 30 should do it.
And besides....not everyone thinks tanned skin is a good look! A girl in my class at school has really pale skin and loves it! Last summer she sat on the beach in a hoody so she couldnt catch a tan!
What ever you decided to do- please dont resort to a sun bed! You'll regret it, i can promise you that
Take care xx
