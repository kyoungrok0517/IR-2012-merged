The Titanic did know about the Icebergs in it's area. The problem was that the ocean was dead calm thus the iceberg was invisible at a distance as there was no wave the break on it's sides had there been rougher seas this disaster wouldn't have happened. As for the radio operator he was very busy with bogus messages coming and going to various passengers proper radio etiquette hadn't been invented yet so a lot of the time a radio operator was handling bogus messages for passengers.
