That link didn't take me to a video,just to youtube. But I agree with you that music has a profound effect on our brains. People with Alzheimer's who cannot talk anymore can still sing old songs they knew before the illness. Some music, synthesized and some new age music can put the brain in an alpha state. It is because there is the unusual rhythm of around 50bpm.

Anything that requires the brain to surf new territory can enhance your mental abilities. Music does that like nothing else. Mozart's music is very mathematical and that is part of the challenge for the mind.If I listen to new age music while sleeping, I have really great dreams that I am singing or hearing someone sing a most amazing performance.

Wish I could have heard that link!
