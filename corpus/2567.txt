For all the passengers and most of the crew, the first they knew was feeling the collision with the iceberg.  A few of the crew -saw- the iceberg ahead and tried to avoid hitting it, and they knew a few seconds before anyone else.

They turned the ship to try to avoid the iceberg.  It is thought that they might have been better off if they'd run straight into it.  As it was the iceberg slid down the side of the ship, slicing it open, opening several of the waterproof compartments.  If they'd hit it head-on, the ship would have been seriously damaged, and some people might have died, but the ship might not have sank.
