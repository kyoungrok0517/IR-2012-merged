There might not be as many as you think. 

Actually the Japanese was not doing real bad in the economy. They have allot of export and they will need people to get back on there feet again and get the country going strong. 

Also, think about it, they already had there disaster, why would they leave the place that already had there's to the place that is over due for one. 

The past few years the natural disasters have been happening in Haiti, South America, New Zealand, China and that's almost full circle.
The USA is over due for ours.
