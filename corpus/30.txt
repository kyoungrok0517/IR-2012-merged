Your "cattery of Bengals & Savannahs"?  That you have noow or dream of having?  I find it VERY hard to believe you're a Bengal/Savannah breeder and don't know that both of these cats - wildcat hybrids - should be fed RAW foods not dry commercial cat food.

And Bengals AND Savannahs?  Reputable breeders tend to have ONE breed they're breeding for the love of and to better the breed.  Pretty damn clear your motivation to want to breed! $$$$$$$$$$$$
