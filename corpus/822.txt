it's just a bunch of leaves or plastic christmas leaves hanging somewhere in your house..  and when u and ur girlfriend are under it, u can just go kiss her for no reason . or u can say, "we're under a mistletoe so i kissed u " 

it's like during new year when u hafta kiss someone at 12:00.. it doesnt really make sense but people have been doing it quite a while so why not do it urself too right?
