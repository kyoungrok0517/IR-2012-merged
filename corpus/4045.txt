You need to supply a few specifics in order to ensure you get the right answer for you.
Your location is everything, of course: not just your latitude, but your aspect (lay of the land/hill facing or facing away from the sun).
Another part is a matter of how much space you have outside in order to set up an array. Unless your unit's a little hot tub, one panel's not going to do it.
Also keep in mind, when working out the total power consumption of the system (assuming the panels are supplying all power) to count the pump.
Too bad the guy who answered first doesn't know how to shop; means nothing in relation to whether solar is a good technology.

Hope that helps. 
Maybe delete this and re ask your question?
