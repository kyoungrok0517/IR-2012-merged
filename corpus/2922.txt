well because alot of bad things are happening right now there....

9/11, virginia tech massacre,, these are only to name a few...

people get dicouraged and think of their safety when they go there.. 

and yes everything you said about america is all true.. but
people with the right mind would rather think of safety than all of that... wouldn't anyone??


Good Luck!
