My first question would be if you are "pigging out" because you are hungry or for another reason. The reason I ask is that some people eat when they aren't hungry and those occasions wouldn't be helped by an appetite suppressant.

That being said, the most popular and beneficial supplements to suppress the appetite are Hoodia Gordonii (an herb) and Slendesta (a potato protein extract). It's a good idea to shop around to make sure you get the best deal from a good quality company. Good luck and I hope I helped!
