The cheapest way to keep the pool warm all year round is to use a heat pump. This can cost around $2 a day to operate. It will also cost you about $5000 to install, and you will also need a cover on the pool to keep the heat in. Gas heating will cost about double to run, but is cheaper to install, and has quicker "heat up" time.
Solar heating can work well at extending the swimming season, but only works when the weather is hot and sunny, so no good in the middle of winter. Again allow about $5000.
A solar cover is the only option in your budget, and will usually keep the pool 5-10 degrees warmer (than ambient temperature), depending on how much sun it gets. A cover will also cut down the amount of evaporation, chemical demand and mess in pool.
