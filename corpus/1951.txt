The people you speak of are all originally derived from,or as far back as we can find evidence of civilization in Europe, the Etruscans.  The Etruscans are a civilization that populated a large portion of Europe beginning in the 13 century BC.  All of our knowledge of them is through writings of Greeks and Romans hundreds of years later since  none of there own writings have survived, the Romans actually consider them their ancestors.  They are realted to the Iron age Villanova civilization as well as Hallstatt Culture, and Illyrians.  As for more modern day histories, The Scots would be the middle age or dark age group/tribe that would have controlled the area.  In other words William Wallace was a Scot.  Vikings on the other hand are from Finland, Sweden, and Norway.
