Food is a big part of Mexican culture, and many foods are traditionally made, like tortillas for instance. They were made first by the indigenous, by hand and cooked on a ceramic plate over an open fire. Now they have tortilla presses, and even torilla machines! Freshness is very important to them when it comes to any food, my husband always prefers the tortillas his mom makes from the corn she grows, to the store bought ones here. Women are very proud of their dishes, and will always invite you to try some, always try a little, thats my suggestion to be nice, and compliment it.
