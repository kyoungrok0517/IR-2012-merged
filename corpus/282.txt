Fasting increases ones self control.
As a person fasts, he not only gains control of his or her physical standards, but also spiritual self and desires.
One can fast from food, therefore, abstaining from food increases your self control- and an increase in self control means you can abstain from sins.
Fasting also brings you closer to God, you are sacrificing your worldly needs for the pleasure of God.
Its more about self control.
