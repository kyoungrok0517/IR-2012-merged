What size tank do you have? 

African Dwarf Frogs are tropical animals, entirely aquatic and generally need to be target fed foods like bloodworm - they don't generally accept pellet foods. They are easily damaged by boisterous fish or in turn can clamp on to slow moving fish thinking they're food! I would personally only recommend ADF's for species tanks, not community tanks.

Piranhas, there are several species but the one you're thinking of is the Red Belly. These fish need to be in big shoals and get around 12" long, they are not really comfortable in any smaller than 250-300 US gallons. Nor are they very exciting - surprisingly shy and only really move when food is introduced.

And no, no Glofish in Australia. Glofish are genetically modified Zebra Danios and several countries including Australia, Canada and the UK have blanket bans on all GM products.

Australia is one of the more restricted countries when it comes to exotic species as you have some very strict import laws over there! You're best going to your local aquatic stores with a pen and paper - leave your wallet at home! - and writing down names of fish that interest you, come back to the internet and research how they should be kept.
