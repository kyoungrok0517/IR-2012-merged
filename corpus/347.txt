Depending on the foreclosure procedure the lender use will determine if they can come after you for anything else.

In California most lenders use the non-judicial foreclosure procedure. Using this procedure they will only come after the collateral listed on the loan docs you signed.

Under this procedure the lender will not seek additional funds from you and in most cases will not sue you for a deficiency judgment. 

If the lender fail to get what is owed on the balance of the mortgage then they simply write if off. If they write off something as a loss then the almighty IRS says that someone must have had a gain. The person having the gain is you, therefore the lender will send you a 1099 indicating the gain you had which is the loss of the lender that foreclosed on your property.

You would have to check with your tax consultant about how to handle the 1099.

I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.
