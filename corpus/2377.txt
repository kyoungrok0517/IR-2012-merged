Earthquakes are the result of friction--most commonly between two tectonic plates sliding past, colliding with, or subducting (one sliding under the other) each other. Other times, it's the result of rocks/material being displaced as magma rises through the earth's crust. This is how Geologists and Volcanologists know when a volcano may erupt. The movement of the magma rising in the volcano causes small seismic earthquakes that set off sensors set around the area.
Basically, an earthquake is the result of a release of energy, or where friction was a factor, but suddenly the tension was released abruptly--this causes a shockwave, known as an earthquake.
Earthquakes (viable for any tectonic boundary), trenches, volcanic arcs and melting are direct results of subduction, or one type of converging plate boundaries.
Some effects, or results of earthquakes are landslides/mudslides, tsunamis, unnatural fires ignited due to electrical power or gas lines, soil liquefaction which leads to the sinking of buildings and destruction of roads/highways & bridges--all of which can lead to a catastrophic death toll. Also, contaminated groundwater from broken sewer lines, gas lines, or household contaminates would lead to disease and death. Monetary losses would also be at a high percentage.
