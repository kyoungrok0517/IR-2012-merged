Jackson was a hero in the postseason and Munson was one of the greatest captains the Yankees have ever had.

Torre should be retired as he resurrected them from (stand point of the Yankees) some miserable seasons with 4 world series.

Jeter will definitely be the last to wear the number 2, he has more hits than any other Yankees save Gehrig i believe, and less than 30 behind him.  He may well finish 2nd to Rose alone.

Arod may or may not be retired depending on how many homers he hits.  Unless the Steroids have ruined his legacy in the eyes of the Steinbrenners.  

I expect by 2030, Triple digits may be an actual possibility.
