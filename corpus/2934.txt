I need not give detailed explanations for my detestation of this nation. I am Russian. My family comes from the former Soviet Union and I currently live in the US. They all preferred the old Soviet system by far to the rubbish that came about after the collapse but it still is a great nation when compared to a festering cesspool like the USA. The American people believe they are superior to all other world cultures because they are subconsciously fed propaganda and lies throughout their entire lives, therefore never knowing any difference. They believe that a nation like Belarus, North Korea or even Russia is so horrible. In truth, they know nothing about what they speak of, they know what was contained within a two or three line statement announced by someone on the local news broadcast. This nation, its culture, a large portion of its citizenry, the lifestyles, endless aspects of its society all sicken me to no end. Nowhere else in the world will you experience and be exposed to the filth that you are in the US outside of a few other useless Western nations such as the UK, Germany, France, Italy, etc. This is not a matter so easy to explain in a written statement on a website. It is also a matter of perception. I'll end in saying that I knew a lady once who would talk about how she used to thank destiny ("God" was not very accepted in USSR) every night before bed that she was born in the Soviet Union and not some place like England or the USA. I now know why.
