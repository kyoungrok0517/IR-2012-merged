I think that the best you will find is data on where they actually go.
I'm somewhat older than the boomers, what is called a "depression baby". I'm a member of the AARP and some other oldephart organizations, and a member of the Gallup and other polls, and don't remember any such survey or results of any such survey. Good luck.
