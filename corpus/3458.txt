I'm watching "Holmes on Homes" on HGTV, and in almost every episode where they correct electrical problems, they install a new breaker panel horizontally.  Is this a common practice in Canada?  The show is produced in Canada, and it is based on Canadian building codes.  I've never seen that before in the US, and it's nothing I would ever do.  I've seen some installed upside-down, though, but I would never do that either.
