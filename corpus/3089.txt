I agree with Kerry K.  But to add to this we do need to wonder about the boring of water from under the tablelands.  The reservoirs of water from underground caverns which are continuously being pumped up to our land level.
Also the glaciers & pack ice of the South and North poles of the planet.  - Because of global warming these are also melting.
The surface area of the Earth is massive so the water level rises very slowly.  The rate of dispersion across such a vast area of water takes a long time. 
But do not doubt that it is rising and will continue to rise.
