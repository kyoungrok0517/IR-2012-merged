I've completed the neccessary courses to be an apprentice, but cannot find any Certified Appraisers that will take me on as an apprentice.   I need to get my hours in order to qualify for a Real estate Appraisal License.  The state agency in charge of the field wont even provide info as to who is qualified to mentor!  I feel stuck and helpless...anyone know how to overcome this hurdle?   or any tips as to where to find assistance?  i'm in New Jersey and i hear this is a tough state to get into the Appraisal business.  Help!!
