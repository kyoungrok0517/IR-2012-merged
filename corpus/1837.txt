life_loverfl is right on the money.  there are an awful lot of variables and he covered pretty much all of them, only missing the taper on the shaft, pro taper or straight taper.  some of what he likes you can figure by looking at what he's using now, but just because it's what he has, doesn't mean he's looking for a match.  I personally have about 7 cues in varying weights, varying degrees of stiffness.  Also, for a few of them I have multiple shafts. a 13.25mm, a 12.75mm, or a 13mm and a 12.5.  the one thing I am consistent on is my tip, moori medium, but that's MY personal preference.  he may like a harder tip, or a softer tip, or he may want 2 of the exact same shafts with 2 different tips, yes they will play differently.  I have a friend who does it that way.  also depending on the brand a new shaft alone can be 100-200 or more, so before you lock into a new cue, perhaps just an extra shaft or two for what he may already have may be an option to look into.
