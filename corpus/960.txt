I saw a magazine last night at the library and the cover said that Jennifer Aniston is trying to have a baby at age 42 and be parents with Justin Theroux. And it's posted here on the Internet too that she wants to get pregnant and have a baby. Is she really pregnant with a baby and planning on being a mother or is it just a rumor and fake storyline?
BQ: Did Jennifer Aniston cheat on Owen Wilson?
