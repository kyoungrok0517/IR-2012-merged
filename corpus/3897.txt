Hi everyone,
I have a bit of a dilemma. As a career i really want to go into Diagnostic Radiography. To get into the uni course, i need to have two science based A-Levels. To be honest tis isn't really the problem as all of my grades are A and above. The thing is what I want to do is take 4 AS levels and then drop one and only take 3 A-Levels. So my options so far are Biology, Physics, Psychology and Spanish, Spanish being the one that I would drop when the time came. The only thing that worries me is that according to my Physics tutor some people have trouble with Physics A-Level if they don't take Maths alongside it. Now I really don't want to take maths, because it isn't really a subject I have my heart in. The thing is if I did have to take it, I would have to get rid of Psychology which i think sounds incredibly interresting. The other choices are untouchable, because i have very specific requirrements, the only changeable one is Psychology. So what should I take? Should I take maths and make my school workload next to impossible, but get better grades in Physics, or take Pyschology which i find really interesting AND it's classified as a science, and risk not knowing some of the Physics as well? I'm confused.com :S
Hey guys,
Thank you so much for your words of wisdom, they've really helped a lot. I am leaning more towards Psychology now, i mean I'm in the top maths GCSE group so we've covered stuff like rearranging algebra and vectors etc. So hopefully i'll be alright!
Again, thanks, damn it'll be hard to pick a best answer cause they're all good :D
