I have had Baby Blues a couple times, and I found the supplement (over the counter herbs and stuff) suggestions in this book EXTREMELY helpful. I think for me, the depression was more about my body not having enough of the amino acids it needed.

Here's the book:

The Mood Cure by Julia Ross
she has a website with a quiz that can tell you if her book can help you. It totally helped me!

BTW, I find "me time" overrated. You don't HAVE to have me time... read the book, my library had it. It can give you your heart and mind back so you don't have to miss out on things.
