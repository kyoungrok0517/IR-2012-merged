Naggh mate, if'n yer go hirin older workers yer gunna have problims mate as those fellas have alf a brain see. They might screw you up for starters mate and fix that Broken Hill of yours !
As to the money, the 50 grand. Well see mate, all thats fixed by a Government Department. The Government being a LABOUR Government mate. Tony? Well he aint silly mate and just took what Labour spent. Same as I bet you took the 900 bucks the Labourites shelled out to everybody a few years back ?
S'all relative mate, ya know it all goes round mate.The money was so the current Government members can save a few bucks before the next election when they get the heave-ho and are out of a job. If there was even a tad of a chance this shower were going to be re-elected no way this pay rise be happenin as they would be comfy thinkin they are back in the drivers seat. Trouble is, the Labour car is drivin straight for the cliff edge and way out of brakes mate.  
But no worries Phil old son, I betcha anything that every Labour crony ever born is appointed as a public servant, ambassador or head of this or that division /department before the next election on huge bucks as thanks and here is the job for the boys as promised. Make you happy mate? Sure it does.Now, where is a scandal I can NOT comment on and get back to introducing policies that will never be a part of my Government if elected?--Unless I need 3 dork independants and a whackjob minor party to appease for the job Im dyin to be the first sheila to get?No matter how.
