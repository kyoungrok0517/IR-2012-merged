Seek the advice of a Financial Planner. I agree with a few of the people here in that your calculations don't sound right. Be skeptical of quick answers to your question. There is no easy answer to this. The same people who say you need to have $X at retirement without knowing much of anything about you and your circumstances are the same ones who tell you how much life insurance to buy simply by multiplying your salary by an arbitrary number. AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE!
