The one piece of equipment that was vital to modern forecasting, in fact to all scientific forecasting, was the electric telegraph invented in 1838. The telegraph allowed meteorologists to find out what the weather was doing in many different places at the same time and plot those data on a chart so that an analysis of the atmosphere could occur. Before the telegraph, sailors, farmers etc had to rely on old rules of thumb to try to forecast what was going to happen from what they could see around them. Robert FitzRoy in England was one of the first to see the benefit of the telegraph and he set up weather stations around the UK and had access to many in Europe via the telegraph and started issuing forecasts based on his data in the mid 1850s.
