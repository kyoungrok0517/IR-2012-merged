.........That is more like a whole Chapter than a paragraph.
.........When typing in "Answers", I find it best to 'Indent' the start of a paragraph by typing a series of dots to emphasis the start of a sentence or paragraph. This is not needed when using a word processor, such as "Word".because then the 'Tab" key is used.
 
..........'Proof reading'.such a large block of text can be a very daunting proposition and as I scan through it, I can see many places which should be typed as separate paragraphs. 
.........
.........I suggest you open it up a little more, and take note of punctuation marks such as "Full stops / Periods", and 'Commas'. .
 
.......Always "Indent" ( or "Tab" if using a computer) the first letter in a new paragraph.

.......Never have more than 2 commas per sentence and never more than three sentences per paragraph.....
.......Start each new paragraph on a new (indented)  line
.......Give emphasis to your words - or phrase - by placing on a new line 

.....Then perhaps a blank line now and again for Extra emphasis

.......I had a look through your text and although it was only briefly,  I can see the great talent you have displayed. I feel that if I tried to change -or alter anything, I might ruin whatever you had in mind.
......I think it's quite a good piece of work. 

......After you have rewritten this in a more open form, I'm sure you will see many places you want to change --- I know I always do to my writing.

Good Luck
