I am sot sure of some of these - treat them as best guesses as some answers that I would have given have a different number of letters to the ones you have provided

12. Oncogenes
14. Lysogenic
16. Icosohedral (20 sided)
22. Shingles ?
26. Tobacco Mosaic Virus

2. Lysogeny
3. Host cell ? (not sure what this is getting at)
5. I would have said "Herpes Simplex" but that is 13 letters How about simply "Herpes Virus"
7. Prion / Virus
18. I would have said "Human Papilloma Virus" but it is the wrong number of letters - however it is a "Dermatropic" virus and that is 11 letters.
