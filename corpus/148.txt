That's right.  The 2012 year is wrong.  But the end can come for any of us today or tomorrow.  We don't know what's in store for us.  We need to be right with God by submitting ourselves to the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  It is not a one-time deal and it is all over with.  A Christian can lose their salvation.  So be sure that you are born again and set free from the slavery to sin.  The Lord changes you if you sincerely want to be changed.  Turn people, turn.  Turn to the Lord Jesus Christ so that He will save you from going to hell.
