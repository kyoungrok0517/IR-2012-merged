They use a current local map of the area and a ruler. All catchment distances are measured as the crow flies - in a straight line that is. Other factors can override the 'distance' criteria, it's different for all schools but many have special educational needs at the top of their list followed by siblings, then distance criteria. Your LEA will let you know. Good luck.
