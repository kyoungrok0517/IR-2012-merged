Water when the soil is dry to the touch, give it sunlight but not direct sunlight because the flowers won't last as long, give it a fertilizer in spring and summer, not during winter or fall because the plant is entering dormancy and if you fertilize it during that time it will die. When the flowers die and you want new flowers bring the orchid in full sun and it will store alot of energy and it will flower again in 3 months, the kind of soil it likes is a soil that is high in nutrients and make sure to put perlite for drainage.
