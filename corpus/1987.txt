You are Talking of The Battle of Largs which was Fought between Haakon Haakonssonn and King Alexander The Third
He and Not Repeat Not Robert The Bruce established Scotland as a Separate Nation It Was The Bruces and The Comyns 
Who Sold Scotland Out and invited Edward The First in as a
Honest Broker to Judge Their Claim on The Scottish Throne.
(Like Turkeys Voting for Christmas ) Big Big Mistake Now why am I saying all this because King Alexander The Second Died 
in Kerrera Bay Just Outside Oban so Two Deaths One near to Oban The Other on The Site of What is Now The BellRock Lighthouse Have you Heard of Sir Patrick Spens???
He was Sent to Norway to Bring Scotlands Future Queen to Her New Home in Scotland She was called "The Maid of Norway and is The Other Death That Caused The Battle of Largs  So The Battle of Largs was not Just Any Battle it was The Battle Which Established The The Free Nation of Scotland.
