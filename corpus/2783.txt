You may want to google a search for "Penumbra wont load after launch Steam."

I had a problem with the game starting as well. It would launch and then close. My solution was some sound file that I had to download. After you do the search, you'll find the steam forums where someone posted a link to the file.

I think it was called AIsound or something.
