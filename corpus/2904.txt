New Jersey:

1. NJ is summed up in this quote. 

"I am from NJ. I curse... a lot. I say "yo", and I say it often. I never had school on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur. I sure as hell don't pump my own gas. I know what real pizza tastes like, and I know that a bagel is much more than a fuckin' roll with a hole in the middle. I judge people by what exit they get off the parkway. I can navigate a circle--with attitude. All good nights must end at a diner--preferably with cheese fries. It's a sub, not a hoagie or, worse yet, a hero, and I wash it down with soda, not pop. Two words... "mother fucker." I don't go to the beach, I go down the shore. And boardwalk brawls are just a part of the atmosphere. Yes, I drink cawfee. I know that 65mph really means 80. I've always lived within 10 minutes of a mall. When someone cuts me off, they get the horn AND the finger. And they expect it. I am from New Jersey, and damn proud of it." 


3. The sickest state that I have ever been in. Hot girls, hot cars, hot beaches! What more can you ask for? 
New Jersey is KILLER.

4. east coast state, discriminated against by those who have been only as far as the outskirts of new york city. while new jersey has its fair share of cities, grime, and crime, a large portion consists of expansive suburbs, beautiful land, and farms.
