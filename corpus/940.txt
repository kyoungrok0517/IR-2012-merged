Hey everyone. I'm in grade 10, going into grade 11 this September, and I am an aspiring actress.  I currently live in Toronto, and have come up with the idea of moving to Vancouver next year thinking it would give me a better chance of landing jobs, because the ratio of movie/tv shows filmed to population in Vancouver is much greater than in T.O. 
However, I do not want to leave home if it is a bad decision.  I am a triple threat, and I have won many awards at acting/musical competitions and have many skills.  I am advanced in Muay Thai (kickboxing) and violin.  I just want your opinion on whether i should go for the jump, and pray for the best, or just stay in Toronto. 
Thank You!
