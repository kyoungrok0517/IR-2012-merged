You need to read the Holy Bible and read the King James Study Bible which will help you understand what Moses did as he was instructed by Almighty God.

It was not Moses' poison or the poison from the Hebrew people, but it was God who sent the death to the first born of Egypt.  Everything done to Egypt was done for the benefit of God's chosen people, the Hebrew nation that God named Israel when he changed Jacob's name to Israel.  God said that He gave His Word to Jacob (Israel).

Exodus 11: 7 KJV "But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast, that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel."

What God did to the firstborn of Egypt for Israel's sake is a sign to all of us of what God will do for His chosen people.  Now read Exodus 12:29-36 concerning the "death of the first born."

It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of Almighty God.
