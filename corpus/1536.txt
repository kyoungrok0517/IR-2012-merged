For Reggie Jackson because what he did for them in the Postseason. Just because he died Munson what he did before his death for the Yankees he was the Yankees captain played with heart and grinded it out and had some good season with them and the Yankee Fans loved the guy. 

Well Joe Torre helped them so much 12 years 4ws 6AL pennants 1996-2007 helped them make the Playoffs.

Jeter no doubt 4ws rings , is going to end up with 3,000 plus hits with the Yankees a ba over 315.

NEXT- Lets see i think it will be Jeter and MO and Torre and also i think they might retire Bernie Williams number that would be nice :D
