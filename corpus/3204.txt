Preah Vihear is a Khmer built temple, but there are a number of other Khmer built temples in Thailand and Laos, since Khmer Empire was big and powerful in X-XIV centuries. Also, if you know the history, Ho Chi Minh City was a small Khmer village a long time ago.
That does not mean anything, because time flies and boundaries change.

What matters is that Preah Vihear was decided by UN court to be Cambodian, and Thailand would better obey the contemporary international law. Preah Vihear is a Cambodian territory by law.
