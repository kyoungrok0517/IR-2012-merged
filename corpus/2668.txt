Right now all you need to do is be there for her. She doesn't know if she is pregnant or not yet, so don't make her stress more by bringing up this topic everytime you are around her. Take her to lunch or out to a movie to try and get her mind off of the situation. If she does find out that she is pregnant then tell her that you'll be there no matter what. A friend that's there regardless of the problem is very helpful even if she doesn't tell you. Try and get her to tell her parents only when she finds out that she is pregnant. Don't add more stress when it's not needed. Hope this helps.
