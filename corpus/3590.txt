Every summer I get a burn working in the yard. The first few days I use sunscreen, but eventually I forget and I get burned. Wouldn't it be more healthy for me to go to a salon and get a nice, slow, non burn tan? I don't burn once I have a tan.

I have read studies that suggest the basis for individual skin cancer happens from sunburns received in childhood. I can't find them now though.
