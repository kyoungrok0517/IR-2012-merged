alrite...what u really should have done is recommended the morning after pill, the morning after 
but lets not talk bout wat u should ahve..

if i had a friend, i would have to be recommend a pregnancy test asap....but im not too sure when the earliest detection day is (i believe even after 3 weeks it can read a false negative after intercourse).....you have 6 days till the tenth...there isnt much you can do but wait  

i personally wouldn't recommend telling the parents quite, because if she isnt pregnant, well you can imagine her parents reactions...

what i would do is possibly take her to planned parenthood, go over options (not you personally, but the workers at planned parenthood)...discuss possible options and wait
