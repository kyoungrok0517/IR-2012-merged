BMI is an arbitrary number - there is no "perfect" as what will look good for one person may nt be right for another.  Take me, technically according to my BMI, at just over 25 I'm overweight, but my body fat is sub 10%, I'm actually quite fit.  If I took my BMI down into the middle of it's range I really wouldn't look so good.

So, ignore BMI, get fit, and learn to self critique your own appearance.
