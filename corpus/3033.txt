I've used Mederma on a burn scar and it healed really fast.  I've also heard that surgeons use it on patients and had really good success rates.  You can find this product at any drug store. 

 If it's a deep scar, a plastic surgeon is probably needed and it could cost between $500 to a couple of thousand.  Most plastic surgeons have a free consultation policy.  Check out a few before deciding on one.  Ask to see other patients.  It will be worth it if it really bothers you. Good luck!
