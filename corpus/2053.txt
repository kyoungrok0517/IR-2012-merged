Skateboarding started out in venice beach california. theres a documentry called "dogtown and Z boys" that gives a total layout of skatboarding history, cultue, style and growth. theres also a really cool movie called lords of dogtown that is closely based on the real life events of Jay Adams, Stacy Peralta and Tony Alva. (part of the original Z boys crew) give em watch , you,ll learn alot. these guys basicly defined skateboarding as we know it. as far improvments go, its wasnt until the early 80s when the skateboard was re designed into a fatter more sturdy stucture with a raised "kick" at the rear end that alows for more of pop when the skater atempts an "ollie" (a pressure baised trick useing weight distribution in order to make the board jump with the skater) . and again in the late 80s they inveted the "double kick" skateboard which had a completely new shape (basicly the skateboard you see today) and it allowed a whole new catalog of tricks as far as professional skateboarding goes... if you wanna see some new age skateboarding id advise going to youtube and reserching chris cole, danny way, rodney mullen, jamie thomas and chris haslam..... these guys are extremly talented. check it out.
