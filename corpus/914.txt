i didn't watch it, but i liked Munich though..
 i know that many Israelis (majority) would love to have peace with Egyptians, and the best way to do that and keep it going is to try to humanize some situations (irrelevant with the main reason of conflict) to deliver the idea that it's ok to live in peace and harmony which is sure ok but the the catch is that it's not in these specific circumstances that we all know about)
the point is, you won't find it offensive..on the contrary!
