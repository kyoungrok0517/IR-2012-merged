Don recommended one of the best small footprint type heaters you can construct yourself. These are pretty effective.

Another way, if you have a large space you can do this with, would be to lay down some black plastic, run a water line in an accordion shape across the top of the plastic, then cover with another black plastic sheet. This is an extremely inexpensive way to heat the pool, especially if the surface area is 1/2 the surface area of the pool or greater. However, it does take some space and isn't the most sightly thing.

The little solar fish or any chemical additives you can put in the pool do not work effectively, cling to swimmers, and filter out. They are a waste of money and can actually cause problems with your water chemistry despite the various claims on the packaging to the contrary.
