YES YES YES YES SOMEONE SEES WHAT I SEE ! 

I totally agree with you. 

I live where it is considered to be one of the most dangerous cities in NYS, where illegal and crime activities are high, and I am very happy here. It is up to the individual and the choices they make.

I went to one of the worst schools in the city, I even had a couple fights and suspension, but at the end I made the right choice to continue my education and go on to college.

BECAUSE IT WAS MY DECISION !
