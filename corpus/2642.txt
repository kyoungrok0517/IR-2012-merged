Dark Knight will beat it in the box office but Titanic will always be iconic because of the various scenes that are still being parodied about it and also the hit song that went with it. Dark Knight is too dark a movie to have scenes played out of it. I saw both and much preferred Dark Knight. I disagree that
Twilight will surpass it. This movie will  have limited appeal.
Although it is well know through the teenager/twenties population it is unlikely that it would hold young children or older adults interest long enough to get them to put down the money to go see it. The books only sold to the teens/twenties mainly. I had never even heard of it until I saw it talked about here a few months ago.
