It's just a matter of self-deprivation.  People fasted then, as today, also for health reasons.  Mormons in the US are supposed to fast one day a month and donate what they would have spent for food to feed the poor.  

In a religious context, fasting helps you focus your mind.  If done right, it eliminates distraction from your life, for a while at least.  It was part of Judaism in Jesus' time.

'A way to tame the ego' is not a bad description!
