This is one of the reasons why speed kills.

People need to be driving at a velocity such that if something unexpected happens in front of you ... another motorist, a pedestrian, a wild animal, you have room to maneuver, and are not going so fast that you will probably die.

There are areas where deer are prevalent, and there are road signs warning of the risk of them coming onto the highway ... we ought to take it a bit slower through those areas.

A tree is a harder target than a deer.

If you hit the deer, it probably demolish the whole front end of car, smash windshiedl, antlers could go through your body ... probably fatal for both driver and deer.

But if you slam on brakes before hitting the deer, the damage much less, you may both survive.

Also slamming on the brakes gives the deer a chance to wander out of the way.

But after you have started to hit the deer, release the brakes, that way the deer is less likely to come all the way thru your windshield.

In other words, foot off gas, maximum brakeing, emergency brake, hazard lights.  As the crash begins, release the brakes, 

Depending on how much time you have, also turn on your hazard lights ... reason ... cars behind you will see you brake brake, not be braking ... the hazard lighs warn that there is a serious serious situation, and they should give you extra space ...it also alerts cars coming other way, that can't see your brake ligtes.

You should only swerve if you are a good enough driver to remain in control of the vehilce.

Another action you might consider is turning off the ignition, to use the engine, as an additional brake ... after this your engine will probably need to be rebuilt or replaced ... very expensive, but maybe not as much as having the whole front end of the car replaced.
