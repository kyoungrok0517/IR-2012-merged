Exercises?  That would make it worse not better.  You have your pain because the muscles in your jaw have tightened up so they aren't working the way they should and once you release them the pain you are having will be gone.  Here's how to release those muscles:
Jaw muscles, TMJ:
Put your fingers on your head so your thumbs are behind your ears.  Press into the back of your jaw next to the skull and hold that pressure.  After 30 seconds slowly raise your head until your neck is fully extended then open your mouth as far as you can.  Release the pressure but hold your head and  mouth like that for another 30 seconds.
If you still have the headache after that is released then you still have tight muscles in your neck and to get rid of that pain you have to release the muscles in your neck.  Here's how to do that:
Neck
Put your hands alongside your head so your thumbs are on the front of the muscle under your ear and your fingers are on the back of the muscle behind your head.  Squeeze your thumb and fingers together and hold.  Relax your body.  After 45 seconds, slowly lower your head as far as you can, release the pressure but hold your neck lowered for another 30 seconds.
With your neck in the lowered position, replace your thumbs in under the ears and your fingers behind your head but right next to your skull this time.  Press your fingers and thumbs together again and hold.  Relax your body while waiting.  When the muscles have all released, slowly lift your head until itâ€™s level again, release the pressure but hold your head like that for another 30 seconds.
for best results relax your body first by taking a deep breath and exhaling.
