While they have got'n alot better the last 10 years at edit'n, if you watch some old school hunting movies it is pretty easy to tell they are fake. In many of them the deer they find looks nothing like the deer they shot. I am thinking it is in Monster Bucks 4 they shoot a deer with a bow and don't show it in slow motion like they do all the others. The deer runs to the next hill top about 200 yards out and turns and looks at them, the camera cuts out with the deer just standing there. I slowed it down and watched it frame by frame. There is no arrow any where around the deer, no hair falling or move'n, no blood, no arrow on the other side, nothing. It is pretty easy to figure out that they edited out the part were some one plugs the deer with a rifle after they missed with the bow. Also, most all of them show off some new deer call. I used to have a job feeding penned up deer. I was able to watch them every day. These came to the sound of me open'n the gate and rattle'n a five gallon bucket the same way the deer on tv come to the new call they are selling, not the way a deer comes into a call in the wild. I wander how long it takes them to train the penned deer to come to a rattle bag after they dump a bag of sweet feed out.
