Someone who studies "ROTC" in college still takes a full array of classes and receives a  BA degree.

A lot would depend on just what you end up doing in military.  Logistics is still logistics. Flying a plane is still flying a plane.  There are a lot of non combat jobs in the military.  Then there is the ever popular job for retired military officers, taking a defense industry job dealing with your former "brother officers."
