Boredom, mostly.  And hospitals usually aren't located in the best parts of town.  But if you folow the safety procedures, you won't be at much greater risk than someone who flies a few times a year (cosmic rays), lives in a major city (nuclear power plants) or visits the dentist annually (X-rays).  Nurses have to empty bed pans among other unpleasant tasks.
