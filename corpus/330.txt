A fasting blood test just means that you are not supposed to eat or drink eight to 12 hours before having blood taken. However, you can--and should--drink water. You should consult your doctor about whether your should avoid medications. The reason for fasting prior to a blood test is so that food and beverages do not influence your test ratings. Your doctor is trying to gauge specific information before any external substances create a false outcome.
