it depends on a few things, one timeframe.  Almost everyone is going FHA now, so the big banks are pretty backed up in their FHA divisions.  Generally a finance company can get a file completed much quicker.  Next are your qualifications, meaning mostly your credit and income.  The lower the credit and the tighter the income, your probably better off going to a finance company as they have fha lenders that specialize in that type of scenario, but going through a broker means paying certain items, such as origination and discount, but keep in mind that any FHA discount fee you pay should be tax deductible (see a tax professional)  Bottom line is anyone can promise you the starts and the moon, work with who you trust the most, not who promises you something, if they promise or quote you something, demand it in writing, this should weed out the jokers, ask about time frames, when you can expect to close, how long does underwriting take, how long is my rate lock.  Talk to a few people, but do not let them pull credit, that could drive down your score, see who you like and proceed from there, good luck
