$85,000 is NOT a reasonable amount to have earned if you are only 25 years old now.

Go to a Financial Planner and have them work with you on making a viable plan for your retirement.  You will want to include long-term care insurance and quite a few other things I am not mentioning here.

Good for you for thinking ahead like this.  Too many people put it off until there is very little time left.  At your age, you will not be able to expect Social Security benefits until after 75 years old.  

Good luck to you.  My husband are currently making these decisions now ourselves, and we both wish we had been able to start thinking about it earlier.

But it is never too late (well, almost) or too early to start planning.  But planning earlier is the much better choice.
