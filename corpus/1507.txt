i found an envelope when i was looking through some boxes and it has a good amount of savings bonds that have been given to me since the year i was born. ive added all the interest up and its a good amount of money. when i cash in the bonds what would that do with my taxes? i really dont plan on cashing them in anytime soon just wondering.
