Solar panels will raise your pool temperature on average 10 degrees warmer than without solar panels.  So if the pool temperature in January is 65 degrees than you can expect to get your pool temperature up to 75 degrees with solar panels.  I learned this since I have been researching solar panel to heat our pool.
