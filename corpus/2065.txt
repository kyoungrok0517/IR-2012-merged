History will get you only so far. Watch more skate videos. Also, keep in mind that street skating is harder to get into because it becomes more of a lifestyle. Meaning that you have to go to places where you can get busted by cops. Try to learn names of tricks too. It's all about memorizing or knowing what changes the basic trick when you do something else. Kind of like the heelflip and varial heelflip. There also are many different names for the same trick (eg. switch kickflip and switch flip).
