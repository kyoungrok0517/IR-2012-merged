What? That is crazy! I got attacked by a monkey in Bali once. It jumped on my head, scratched my face, and took my sunglasses. I was so pissed. 

A wild camel. Well the doctors in Egypt will probably laugh at you if you come in telling them a camel spat in your eye. My advice it wash your eyes out, make sure your sister is still breathing and try to stay away from camels.

Have fun traveling.
