I just made this one the other day. It was cool. It requires whatever you need to make ordinary sugar cookies, plus green food coloring, red decorating gel, and sliced almonds.

Witch's Fingers

Make sugar cookie dough, except add several drops of green food coloring to the mix and blend it until you've got a pleasant light green tint evenly distributed.

Divide the dough into approximate fourths or smaller batches. Grease a cookie sheet or put parchment paper on it. Take out of batch of cold dough and put the rest back in the refrigerator. Take one rounded teaspoon of dough and form a cylinder the size of a child's finger. (Be quick or the dough gets hard to work with from the heat of your hands.) Set it on the cookie sheet and shape it into a finger, with two knuckles and a rounded tip. When you've filled the cookie sheet, use your scrupulously clean fingernails or a butter knife to add creases to the knuckles.

Bake, watching carefully for the bottoms not to brown, according to sugar cookie recipe directions. Let cool completely.

When cool, put a generous dot of red decorating gel at the rounded end of each finger and press an almond slice onto it firmly, allowing the red to ooze out slightly, for bloody fingernails. When all the cookies are done, if there's gel left over, bloody the "stump" end.
