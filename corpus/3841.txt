Yes, most jobs in the private sector that aren't unionized are "at will" and the employee can be fired for no reason at all.  The problem here is Unemployment Compensation.  The employer has to pay Comp. if he fires an employee, UNLESS he fires her for breaking a rule or for wilful misbehavior or other "good cause."  Bullying other employees could be "good cause" but he would have to be able to prove it, prove he warned/counselled her about it and prove she kept on doing it.  He'd need to keep records.
