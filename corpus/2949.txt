I am studying the new and previous atomic theories in school. I have to write five facts/ main points about each. I'm stuck on the electron cloud model because there doesn't seem to be a site that just gives me the straight facts and not a bunch of confusing mumbo jumbo. 
All I want to know is 5 main points or ideas that the Electron/ Wave cloud supports. Okay? 
Thanks to anyone who answers. I really appreciate it! Really!
