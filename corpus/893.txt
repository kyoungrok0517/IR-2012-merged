I am an American living with my Mexican husband in a small town in the Mayan Rivera.  Here are some of the recipes that I would make... http://cooking1handed.blogspot.com/search/label/Mexican

how old is the class?  I would say make a good guacamole... chunky chopped avocado, chopped white onion. little garlic, chopped tomato, fresh lime juice, and some salt and cilantro. with chips- always good- DO NOT BRING THE STORE BOUGHT KIND!!! I cannot stand that stuff.  

Another easy thing is to bring a spread like you would have at a tyipical party here... 
 
in seperate tupperware... spansih rice, refried beans, some pico de gallo (chopped onion, tomatoe, garlic, salt, pepper, lime juice and cilantro)  some saauteed onion and bell pepper, some flat steak or simple chicken breast and some tortillas.  This is a pretty common dinner at our house and common for parties.  You could also have some lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and hot sauce (Valentina is my fav hot sauce here in Mexico and is available all over the USA

depending on where you are from you could make a Mayan dish!  I have a bunch of recipies from all over Mexico.  Feel free to let me know where your family is from and I can give you an idea from that area.
