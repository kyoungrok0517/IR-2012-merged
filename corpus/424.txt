Because for some reason, the Golden Calf not only looked amazing but also came to life and began to interact with people! This was beyond human imagination! I mean how can a golden calf, that is not flesh and blood can start moving and making sounds! Plus Moses brother was there with them and did nothing to stop the Israelis and tell them to wait for Moses to return. When Moses, return, he was really upset with his brother more than he was the Israelis! And there was a respected man called Samiri who encouraged people to warship the cow!
