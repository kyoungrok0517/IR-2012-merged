You didn't specify what your investment vehicle is, but I see things a bit differently.

You mentioned that you are being charged a "percentage," when you withdraw your money, early.  Yes, that could very well be tax withholding, for which you will receive credit, when you file your tax return, but I am wondering if your investment vehicle is an annuity, where you are paying the insurance company a "Contingent Deferred Sales Charge (CDSC)" for a withdrawal of more than 10% of your accumulated balance.  That CDSC is not a tax, at all, but a sales charge, or commission.

Then, come tax filing time, yes, you owe income tax, at ordinary income tax rates, multiplied to the amount of your withdrawal.

The scenario is similar if your investment vehicle is Class B mutual funds, where a deferred sales charge, for early withdrawal, applies.

In any case, and similar to the other answers, since you will receive credit for tax withheld, you are not being double-taxed.
