If you had a plastic surgeon remove the moles you must have had a followup visit so they could check on the progress of the incision.  Did you ask them about the sunken area and widening then?  If so, what did they tell you?  If the surgeon told you that the scarring you have now is the best you could have hoped for, then there isn't too much you can do about it.  If they bother you tremendously, go back and ask if they can be reduced.  You can also get waterproof makeup that is specifically for coverage of scars.  Remember that they are probably more obvious to you than to  other people.  Good luck.
