I believe in the old saying, "Everything in Moderation". If you use tanning beds in moderation, and only a few minutes at a time, there's nothing wrong with it. You'll have a nice golden glow eventually and if you bask on the beach in the summer it's a good way get started early. You need a certain amount of sun each day for your Vitamin D intake. Don't listen to the nay sayers about stuff being bad for you all the time. Start out tanning maybe a 1/2 hour at a time and work up from there. As soon as you feel a bit of pinching on the skin, get in the shade or put a shirt on.
