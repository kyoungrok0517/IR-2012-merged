If you have a 401k, you are definetely on the right track! Just keep it up and stash away as much money as you can.
It depends how much you are gonna need to retire. If you retire at 60, estimate you might spend around 35 years in retirement. In general, people need around 75% of their current annual income when they retire. So multiply your annual salary by 0.75 and by 35 years - that is how much you will need to retire in comfort. Keep in mind inflation and return on your investments. Good luck!
