I wear a yellow helmet, yellow jacket, and ride a yellow Honda 1800 Goldwing.  I have been told by my fellow workers that I am very visible.  It does help to have lots of headlights and tail lights.  
Best, easiest colors are the bright yellows, whites, and neon yellows, greens, and oranges.  Look at the safety gear issued to highway workers.  
3M offers a highly reflective tape called SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea)  Here is a source of the tape.

The reflect-ability of tape is really amazing.
There are riding vests available that are equipped with this type of tape.  Here is the one I wear.
