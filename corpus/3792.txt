Elizabeth gave you a good list of what is used to record the weather. But forecasting it takes much more; Since the beginning of the last century, so many nations have worked to what is truly the first international co-operation that has gone ever since, even in time of war.

Because knowing temperature, atmospheric pressure and wind direction for a place doesn't say much about what will come the day after.

It requires the drawing of a map with high, low pressures and wind for large areas. And ever since ships were equipped with radio, a daily report of the observed weather on the seven seas has been very precious to draw such weather maps.

Today, it is the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that is in charge of gathering all data. It is then redistributed to all the participating nations, together with their own forecast based on complex computer simulation.

But that is only the big picture. Local weather persons work then the local forecast based on local knowledge.

For example, all airports have a weather report facility for airmen has a meteorologist that knows very well the local conditions from years of practice. If, for example, the big picture is for a high pressure with clear sky and little wind, the local person may know that, due to the close vicinity of at large body of water, early morning fog can be expected.
