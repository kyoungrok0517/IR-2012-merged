I only really know about Ireland, so here you go. Ireland was split up between the parts under English control and the Gaelic Irish. The English-controlled (generally Protestant-ish) people would have shared England's enemies and allies. The Gaelic Irish saw the English as their biggest enemy. 

So when the English were at war with France, the Gaelic Irish tried to work with France. 

Generally, though, the Gaelic Irish tended to find allies amongst the Catholic nations of Europe (Spain and France, mainly) and probably saw themselves against Protestantism. 

They didn't tend to try and actively make enemies, though, and no other country (other than the English) actively tried to take over the Irish during this period.
