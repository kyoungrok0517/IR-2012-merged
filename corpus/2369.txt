thats nothing to do with it earthquakes are causes by the plate tectonics moving around- they are less dense than then mantle which they float on. So since the core is around 4000c this causes slow moving convection currents in the mantle. These convection currents cause movement of the plates which float on the mantle, and when they hit each other a earthquake happens. Also when two plates slide together it happens
