Situation: I live in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. I got accepted to Rutgers University. I got a scholarship of  $8,000 per year. Financial aid will pay the rest. Problem: I currently have a C in AP statistics. Parents are spazzing out saying that going to Rutgers with a C will drop my scholarship. I know I can bring it up, but I'm tired of the headache of not knowing where I'm going to go to college. I only have a month left of High school. It's now 50/50 between Rutgers and Alabama (a little towards Rutgers). Are their any facts I could use about Rutgers to push them towards making a decision?
