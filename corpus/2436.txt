There are a number of factors here.  You usually have the option to roll over a prior employers retirement account to a new employer or to an IRA.  Now the fact that the market is down is a totally different question.  The fact that the market has depreciated has little to do with what you should do.  If you're closer to retirement you probably want to go into investments that preserve more capital and have less risk.  If you're young then you can afford the short term risk and should continue to invest aggressively.  Young would be under 45, if you're in your mid to late 50's you should be in safer investments.  That's because you don't have the time to recover the losses that someone younger does.  

Now consider this.  You want to move it because it's down.  So you're taking it out of your mutual funds that have lost value, and putting them into other mutual funds with another company that have also lost value.  The only difference is you didn't experience the losses in the new account.  Check the performance of the funds in your new plan, I'm sure they've lost value.  

I recommend consulting a financial adviser and be open.  Explain to him your concerns and your objectives.  What is your age, when do you plan to retire, how much do you expect to live off of during retirement, what other income do you expect to have during retirement.  All very important factors in planning out your retirement.  It will impact how aggressive you should be investing.  

Good luck!
