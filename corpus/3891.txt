I think you're right to be scared about this. The issue with vaccines is particularly worrying, because it is essential to have good population coverage for the diseases to be kept at bay, yet people act as if the decision whether to vaccinate their child will only affect them. I agree that they don't seem to care about the risks to everyone else. For medical reasons, I didn't have the vaccine for whooping cough (pertussis), but because everyone else was vaccinated I should have been safe. Unfortunately when I was three there was a health scare over the vaccine - I got the disease, was ill for three months and lost half my hearing. Plenty of others were disabled or died. It's so needless. 

Have you heard of the book "Bad Science" by Ben Goldacre? He devotes a whole chapter to autism/vaccinations and explains exactly where this fear came from. He explains in simple terms how ordinary people can assess the huge amount of different 'facts' and opinions that they hear - how they can try to decide what sources of information are reliable. I think people need more education in this area - we're living in an information age and people can find 'facts' on the internet to support any opinion they like, but most people are unable to tell what is reliable and what is nonsense. And if a doctor or scientist tells them that something is nonsense, they cannot understand how that person can make that judgement. 

Ben Goldacre rants a lot about the media in his book - he points out that no-one would dream of getting some uninformed junior journalist with a history degree to write a complicated article in the finance section - they would get a financial expert. But when it comes to science, the stories get handled by people who have no idea what they are talking about. 

With autism, I think you CAN prove nonexistence - I think the studies done have been so large (tens of thousands of kids) that we can now say that there is no link.
